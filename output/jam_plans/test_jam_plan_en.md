# Test Jam Plan

**Main Part:** 30 minutes

---

## Session Overview

The plan consists of 1 blocks. Each block includes concepts and exercises. Total duration of main part: ~30 minutes.

### Feedback Principles

- **One voice at a time:** after a scene, one selected person gives feedback, others add only upon request.
- **Participant sensitivity:** ask players in advance what style of feedback they want (soft, supportive / more direct).
- **Observable behavior, not personalities:** frame observations through concrete actions in the scene, not through assessments of people.

## Plan by Blocks

### Block 1. Test Block (~30 minutes)

**Concepts:**

**Base Reality**

The established normal, realistic context of a scene before the first unusual thing (game) happens. It includes the Who, What, Where, and the physical/emotional state of characters.

*How to apply:* Establish a clear, specific, and realistic foundation for your scene through agreement with your scene partner. This allows the audience to recognize what is unusual when it appears, which marks the beginning of the comedy.


**Exercises:**

**EXERCISE: THREE LINE SCENES**

A practice exercise for quickly and efficiently establishing the Who, What, and Where of a scene.

*Instructions (group of 6–10 people):*
Two improvisers perform short scenes that last only three lines of dialogue. This forces performers to establish the Who, What, and Where as quickly and clearly as possible without wasting time or adding unnecessary information.

_During discussion after exercises, give feedback one person at a time, paying attention to tone and player needs._
