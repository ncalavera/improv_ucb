## Example 1: Game vs Plot Comparison

### Haiku Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Split the image into two columns labeled "ИГРА (Game)" and "СЮЖЕТ (Plot)". 

Left side (Game): Show a stick figure with a lightbulb above their head, labeled "Что смешного?" (What's funny?). Include simple icons: a pattern symbol (repeating squiggles), an upward arrow, and a star.

Right side (Plot): Show three stick figures in different positions with labels "КТО? (Who?)", "ЧТО? (What?)", "ГДЕ? (Where?)". Include a simple scene marker (building outline).

At the bottom, add an arrow pointing to the Game side with text "Это то, что создает комедию" (This creates comedy).

Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

### Sonnet Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Show two contrasting sections divided vertically. LEFT SIDE labeled "СЮЖЕТ (не смешно)" shows three stick figures with labels: "КТО" (stick figure waving), "ЧТО" (stick figure holding something), "ГДЕ" (stick figure standing near simple house outline). RIGHT SIDE labeled "ИГРА (смешно!)" shows the same three stick figures but now engaged in unusual pattern behavior with arrows connecting them in a cycle, and a star symbol with "ПАТТЕРН" label. Add a large "≠" symbol between the two sides. Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

**Comparison**: 
- Haiku: More detailed, step-by-step description with specific elements
- Sonnet: More concise, single paragraph, includes humor ("не смешно" vs "смешно!")

## Example 2: Pattern Recognition

### Haiku Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Show two rows of sequences.

Top row: Numbers 3, 6, 9 arranged horizontally with plus signs between them. Label as "ПАТТЕРН 1: +3 (Pattern 1: Add 3)". Below the first number write "Необычная вещь" (Unusual thing). At 9, add a star and label "ЗАКРЕПЛЕНО" (Locked). Show a stick figure below with checkmark expression.

Bottom row: Numbers 3, 6, 12 arranged horizontally. Label as "ПАТТЕРН 2: ×2 (Pattern 2: Multiply by 2)". Below the first number write "Та же необычная вещь" (Same unusual thing). At 12, add a star and checkmark.

Add a speech bubble from a stick figure: "Оба правильные!" (Both correct!).

Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

### Sonnet Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Show three panels horizontally. PANEL 1: Stick figure points at number "3" with label "ПЕРВАЯ НЕОБЫЧНАЯ ВЕЩЬ". PANEL 2: Another stick figure adds "6" with arrow showing "+3" and label "ПЕРВЫЙ ХОД ИГРЫ" with question mark above head (confused face). PANEL 3: Third stick figure confidently adds "9" with "+3" arrow, label "ПАТТЕРН УСТАНОВЛЕН!" and checkmark. Below all panels show the sequence "3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15..." with "ИГРА = +3" in a box. Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

**Comparison**:
- Haiku: Shows both patterns (3-6-9 and 3-6-12) side by side, more comprehensive
- Sonnet: Focuses on one pattern progression, includes emotional states (confused → confident)

## Example 3: Orange Example (Multiple Patterns)

### Haiku Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Show a central orange circle (simple drawing) with text "ОРАНЖЕВЫЙ" (Orange) and "Первая необычная вещь" (First unusual thing) below it.

From this center point, show three branches radiating outward, each showing a different pattern:

Branch 1 (left): Circle labeled "ОРАНЖЕВЫЙ" → square labeled "СИНИЙ" → triangle labeled "ЖЕЛТЫЙ". Label pattern: "ЦВЕТА (Colors)"

Branch 2 (top): Circle "ОРАНЖЕВЫЙ" → simple fruit shape "АНАНАС" → simple fruit shape "ЯБЛОКО". Label pattern: "ФРУКТЫ (Fruits)"

Branch 3 (right): Circle "ОРАНЖЕВЫЙ" → simple sphere "БЕЙСБОЛЬНЫЙ МЯЧ" → simple sphere "ГЛОБУС". Label pattern: "КРУГЛЫЕ ПРЕДМЕТЫ (Round objects)"

Three stick figures at bottom each pointing to different branches with happy expressions.

Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

### Sonnet Version
```
Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Center top shows "ОРАНЖЕВЫЙ" in a circle as starting point. Three arrows branch downward to three stick figures, each presenting their pattern. LEFT stick figure (artist with palette): "синий, желтый" with label "ИГРА: Цвета". MIDDLE stick figure (holding fruit): "ананас, яблоко" with label "ИГРА: Фрукты". RIGHT stick figure (holding ball): "бейсбольный мяч, глобус" with label "ИГРА: Круглые предметы". All three stick figures have happy/confident faces. Bottom text: "ВСЕ ПРАВИЛЬНЫ! Одно начало → разные игры". Three checkmarks below. Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
```

**Comparison**:
- Haiku: More detailed visual layout (radiating branches, specific shapes)
- Sonnet: More character-focused (artist, fruit-holder, ball-holder), includes encouraging text
