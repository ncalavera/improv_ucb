Create a simple educational diagram using stick figure style (xkcd-like). Show a branching path diagram illustrating two different game patterns emerging from the same starting point. At the top, display "НАЧАЛО" (Start) with two numbers: 3 and 6 in circles connected by an arrow. Below this, the path splits into two branches with a stick figure at each branch point looking thoughtful. LEFT BRANCH: Show the sequence 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 in connected circles, with a happy stick figure next to it. Label this pattern "+3 к предыдущему" (Add 3 to previous) with a checkmark. RIGHT BRANCH: Show the sequence 3 → 6 → 12 → 24 → 48 in connected circles, with another happy stick figure next to it. Label this pattern "×2 предыдущее" (Multiply previous by 2) with a checkmark. At the bottom, add text "ОБЕ ИГРЫ ПРАВИЛЬНЫЕ!" (Both games are correct!) with a stick figure showing excited celebration pose with arms up. Use arrows to show the flow and progression. Include a thought bubble from the central stick figure saying "Какой паттерн?" (Which pattern?). Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography. Minimal style. 4:3 aspect ratio.
