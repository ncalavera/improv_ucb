Then imagine the first game move is the number 6.\n\nAt this point, the game is still not cemented because we have still not clearly established a pattern. Imagine that the next game move is 9.\n\nAt this point, if you are going to successfully follow this pattern, you are going to have to 'Add 3 to the previous number.' We have already agreed that 'Add 3' is what is funny.\n\n### Now let's start over\n\nNow, instead of 9 being the next game move, let's imagine that the next game move is 12.\n\nYou might describe this game as 'Multiply by 2.' In this case, we have agreed that what is funny is 'Multiplying the last number by 2.'\n\nBoth patterns are completely valid, and they both started from the same first unusual thing. The same thing will happen with the game of the Scene. Any number of games can come from the same starting place.\"\n\n**Key concept:** From the same starting point (3 → 6), two different valid games can emerge: one following +3 pattern (→ 9 → 12 → 15...) and another following ×2 pattern (→ 12 → 24 → 48...). Both are correct!",
