Left side (Game): Show a stick figure with a lightbulb above their head, labeled "Что смешного?" (What's funny?). Include simple icons: a pattern symbol (repeating squiggles), an upward arrow, and a star.

Right side (Plot): Show three stick figures in different positions with labels "КТО? (Who?)", "ЧТО? (What?)", "ГДЕ? (Where?)". Include a simple scene marker (building outline).

2. **Pattern mechanism** (Numbers examples showing pattern building)
3. **Multiple valid paths** (Different games from same start)
4. **Mental shift** (Yes And to If Then transition)
5. **Recognition** (Finding the first unusual thing)
6. **Building blocks** (Game moves creating pattern)
7. **Real examples** (Monty Python framework)
8. **Metaphor** (Forest path - game as navigation aid)
