  "content": "## Image 10: Three Different Patterns from Orange\n\n**Title/Description**: Example showing three valid games from \"orange\" - colors, fruits, round objects\n\nThis image should illustrate how from the same starting point \"оранжевый\" (orange), three different game patterns can emerge:\n1. Colors: оранжевый → синий → желтый (orange → blue → yellow)\n2. Fruits: оранжевый → ананас → яблоко (orange → pineapple → apple)\n3. Round objects: оранжевый → бейсбольный мяч → глобус (orange → baseball → globe)\n\nThe key concept is that \"ИГРА\" (Game) has a wordplay meaning in Russian - it means both the improv concept \"Game\" and also \"game/play\" as an activity. So \"ИГРА: Цвета\" uses this wordplay where we're playing a game with colors, and \"ИГРА\" refers to both meanings. This wordplay must work in Russian context.",
