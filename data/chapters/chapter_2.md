used suddenly pulled out a mimed gun. This would be very distracting.
An improviser using an actual object in a scene has the same effect.
Another reason not to use actual objects is that doing so can paint you
into a corner. While you could take off your actual jacket, you could not
hang it on an imaginary coat rack.
The one exception to not using actual objects on stage is chairs, as
some scenes will require you to sit.
Taking these aspects of your objects into consideration will help you
to better commit to your reality. It will make your acting more realistic
and help you to visualize your environment.
Before we move on, please keep in mind these two additional points that
are important to the beginning of any Long Form scene.
First, it is important for you to maintain the environment that has
been established during the base reality section throughout the rest of
the scene. Many new improvisers will “drop” their environment once
they begin talking. Keeping your characters grounded in the world
established at the start of the scene will help you to keep your audience
engaged in the reality you have created. Also remember, you will later be
able to use this environment as a vehicle through which you can explore
the comedy of your scene.
Additionally, while establishing the base reality of your scene is very
important, you want to be sure to avoid simply talking about whatever it
is that you and your scene partner are doing. Once you start speaking,
you don’t want to just speak about your physical environment. In order
to more closely mirror real life, you should push yourself to determine
the Who, What and Where of the scene by talking about .%4#1*,&8(#9.#(
as you remain engaged in the physical choices you’ve made. If you think
about it, this is how we usually behave in real life. Your goal should be to
simply exist in your Who, What, and Where.”

CHAPTER ONE * What is a Base Reality?

EXERCISE: TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE

INSTRUCTIONS
Two improvisers take the stage.

One improviser will initiate with some sort of physical
activity that can be done continuously throughout the scene
(sorting mail, washing dishes, having dinner, playing golf,
setting up a camp site, etc.).

The other improviser should immediately join in with

this activity.

When either improviser starts speaking, they must talk about
something other than what they are doing.

PURPOSES

In real life, you are usually doing one thing and talking about
another. For example, if you’re folding laundry, you are most
likely not talking about folding laundry. This exercise will
help you to better mirror this reality of life in your scenes.

SECTION ONE * CHAPTER TWO

How to
Create
a Base
Reality

In this chapter we go

over how to make your
base reality strong and
truthful. The more
truthful and committed
you are with your base
reality, the easier it will be
for your game (the comedy
of the scene) to stand out.

Topics covered:

¢ Make ita priority to listen well

« Practice good give-and-
take with each other

« Commit to the reality of the scene

« Avoid detachment—including
unintentional detachment
and ironic detachment

« Play to the top of your intelligence—
don’t agree to things blindly or be
oblivious to things for no reason

« Avoid denials, which include pulling
the rug out, being inattentive
and dueling initiations



Listening
a Long Form improv scene with
someone else, there is nothing more important than listening. The
beginning of the scene is built through Yes And, and you cannot Yes And
something if you haven’t heard it. It is important to listen because you
are going to have to agree with and add to what your scene partner has
just said. The last thing said on stage is either going to make your base
reality more detailed and specific, or it will be the first unusual thing,
the start of your game.
The start of the scene, like a basement, needs to be strong enough
to support everything else that will be built upon it. Listening needs to
happen so that you and your scene partner are on the same page about
what 3,&’(of house you are building. If you don’t actively listen at the
beginning of a scene, you may think that you are building a house out of
straw, while your teammate thinks you are building it with bricks.
The goal of the beginning of the scene is to establish a relatable
reality from which an unusual or absurd thing can be recognized.
None of this will be possible if you are not actively listening. A great
improviser is a good listener.

To be able to communicate effectively and build a Long Form scene with
another improviser, you have to learn when to speak and when to listen.
This is called !"#$%&’(%)&*$.
One improviser shouldn’t be doing all of the work in a scene. By giving
and taking focus, you share the burden of discovery and creation. Giving
and taking are equally important. It is important that you stop talking
and !"#$%focus to your scene partner when they want to add to the scene.
It is equally important that you begin speaking and )&*$ focus from them
when you have something to contribute to the scene.
There is nothing more awkward to watch on stage than two
improvisers fighting for focus. An ability to give and take focus is
necessary for good listening.

Each group of improvisers should commit physically to the idea that
they are different parts of the same cocktail party.

All three groups are given the same suggestion to inspire three
different conversations. For example, if the suggestion was “gun,”
one group may talk about gun control, another group may talk about
Guns N’ Roses, and the third group may talk about video games.

The conductor calls out the number of the group that will have focus.

While one group is speaking, the others should mime a conversation
while listening to what is being said.

When the conductor calls out a new number, the previous group gives
focus by stopping their conversation. The new group takes focus by
starting or resuming their conversation.

After a few rounds of calling out numbers, the conductor falls away
and the three groups begin giving and taking focus on their own. The
improvisers should look for natural pauses in conversation and take
focus by loudly and clearly re-starting their conversation.

Each group should take the passage of time into consideration

as they return to their conversation. You are not “pausing” your
conversation and picking it up exactly where you left off; it should be
assumed that your characters have been talking while you have been
miming and the other group has had the focus in the scene.

VARIATION

Use the same basic set-up, but this time each group should listen
carefully to the group currently speaking.

After each group has had at least two opportunities to speak, you
should look for ways to make connections between your conversation
and the other conversations happening.

When your group retakes focus, try to incorporate specifics, details,
ideas, and themes that you heard mentioned by the other groups.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this exercise is to allow improvisers to practice taking
and giving focus in group scenes.

This variation of the exercise gives new improvisers another
opportunity to practice listening.

If you are really listening to the other conversations, you should be
able to find ways for themes and ideas to overlap naturally. This is a
skill you will use often when performing Long Form.



CHAPTER TWO + How to Create a Base Reality

EXERCISE: “YES...AND”
SCENEWORK
INSTRUCTIONS

¢ Atleast three improvisers are needed for this exercise.

¢ Two improvisers perform a scene from a single suggestion given by the
third. The third improviser watches the scene.

¢ One improviser will initiate, or give the first line of the scene.

¢ Theimprovisers will then literally say “Yes And” at the start of each
successive line. The “Yes And” will come in this form:

« “Yes” [repeat the information from the last line]
« “And” [add new information to the scene]

¢ Statements are necessary for this exercise. Questions won’t add new
information; they will only force your scene partner to add information.
Imperatives (e.g. “Come here!”) also fail because they often force your
scene partner to do something without adding new information about
the Who, What, and Where. Statements allow you to more quickly
establish a reality and find something unusual to explore in that reality.

¢ Make sure that your Yes And statements add information to the present
moment and the characters in the scene. Avoid Yes And statements that
refer to the past, the future, or characters not in the scene.

* Resist the urge to “Yes...But.” Someone else in your group should stop
the scene every time a scene partner says “But” instead of “And” to
give them a chance to deliver a different line without “But.” “Yes...But”
shows a desire to argue instead of building the scene together.

PURPOSE

* One purpose of this exercise is to practice listening in a Long Form
scene. You must be listening carefully in this exercise since you will
have to repeat what was just said. Repeating the information from the
previous line proves that you have been listening.

e When you add new information in your line, you are showing that you
understand your partner’s contribution to the scene.

« Yes And scenes usually feel a little stilted. However, this exercise is
essential for getting the behavior of Yes Anding into your muscle
memory. Before things become second nature, we need to practice
them consciously.

* This exercise will make it glaringly obvious whether or not you are
listening. This exercise prevents you from skipping this important
scene work step.



“VES...AND” SCENE EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and I’m so happy
you remembered our wedding anniversary.”

(Player 2 has established the Who and What with this “Yes And.” We
now know that the characters are a married couple celebrating a
wedding anniversary.)

PLAYER 1: “Yes, you’re happy | remembered our wedding
anniversary, and let’s eat this tonight when we
come home from dinner.”

(Player 1 has started to establish the Where with this “Yes And.” We now
know that the couple is in their house, getting ready to go to dinner.)

EXAMPLE 2

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”
PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and everyone else
in the office is going to be jealous of me.”

(Player 2 has established the Where with this “Yes And.” We now know that
the characters are at their workplace.)

PLAYER 1: “Yes, everyone in the office will be jealous of you,

and you just tell them that if their sales were as
high as yours, I’d bake them an apple pie, too.”



CHAPTER TWO + How to Create a Base Reality

BAD “YES...AND” SCENE EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and it is on

a plate.”
(Player 2 has not really offered an “And” for the scene in this example. You
want to go beyond the obvious of what you probably already know or could

assume when you Yes And. No new information has been established with the
“And” in this example.)

EXAMPLE 2

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and | used to have
apple pie every Sunday when | was a kid.”

(Player 2 has made this scene about the past.)

EXAMPLE 3

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and Ill eat this
tomorrow with my lunch.”

(Player 2 has made this scene about the future.)

EXAMPLE 4

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and my brother
Mike loves apple pie.”

(Player 2 has made the scene about a character not in the scene.)



EXAMPLE 5

PLAYER 1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

PLAYER 2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, but I’m

not hungry.”

(Player 2 has done “yes but” instead of “Yes And.” Doing so will start your
scenes off with unnecessary conflict.)

EXERCISE: THREE LINE SCENES

INSTRUCTIONS

Have any number of improvisers form two single-file lines on
opposite sides of the stage. The line on the left side of the stage
will be the “initiation” line. The line on the right will be the
“response” line.

One improviser from each line will step forward to perform
a scene inspired by a suggestion offered by someone else in
the group.

¢ Left Side will initiate.
¢ Right Side will respond to the initiation.
Left Side will respond to the response.

After the three lines, each improviser should go to the end of the
opposite line. The next two improvisers in line then step out, get
another suggestion, and do a new three-line scene.

These three-line scenes will not be complete scenes. They will
end after the third line. These scenes don’t have to reach any
sort of resolution. You should still make strong choices and
commit as if these are going to be full-length scenes.

Continue until everyone has had a chance to initiate
and respond.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this exercise is to practice establishing the Who,
What, and Where as quickly and clearly as possible. It will be
easier for you to establish this information if you make strong
choices at the top of your scenes.



CHAPTER TWO + How to Create a Base Reality

EXERCISE: CONDUCTED STORY

INSTRUCTIONS
Three or more improvisers stand in a line.

Another improviser will stand in front of them and act asa
“conductor” for a story that they will tell together.

The conductor points at an improviser, who begins telling
a story.

The conductor will then randomly point at a different
improviser. The improviser currently speaking will abruptly
stop telling the story. Then, the new improviser being pointed
at will pick up telling the story at the exact moment where
the previous improviser left off. The same rule will apply each
time the conductor points to a new improviser.

The conductor can point to a new improviser at any time.

Caution: Don’t try to be funny. Don’t try to add absurd
twists for laughs. Your only goal is to tell a simple story with
aclear plot and consistent tone throughout, as if written by
a single author.

PURPOSE

This exercise will improve your listening by forcing you to be in
the moment. You don’t know when you are going to be called
on to speak. You could have to continue telling the story at any
point—the end of a sentence or in the middle of a word. This
means that you must be listening intently to know both what
has been said just before you are called upon to speak, AND
what has happened so farin the story as a whole.

If you do a good job of listening, you will be able to tell a
seamless story that sounds as if it is coming from one person.



Commitment
in Long Form
Improvisation. All elements of a scene outside of the game (5/%D>’’.%
?&/)%5D%)1$%2<$’$@ should be grounded in the reality that the performers
have agreed upon. Obviously, this includes your performance. You could
be following all of the rules we have presented and still not draw an
audience into your reality if you do not commit.
In simplest terms, <5==")=$’) is good acting. A Long Form
improviser is expected to invest in the reality of the scene in such a way
that the audience doesn’t see an improviser, but a believable character
on stage. Good actors in movies or television disappear into their roles.
Bad actors “take you out of the movie.” Good acting and commitment
to the choices you make in a scene will help your audience become
engaged in the reality you are creating.
A commitment to the reality of the scene does not mean that every
scene you perform has to take place in our reality. It means that you can
do scenes about vampires, pirates, or truckers in deep space, as long
as you are committing to the specific reality in which we might find
these sorts of characters. You must make choices about how to portray
these characters and then remain consistent with your portrayal of the
characters for the entire scene.
Focusing on commitment will prevent you from forcing an “unusual
thing.” If you commit to your characters and portray them as real
people, it will make it easier for you to recognize the unusual when it
happens organically.
Commitment allows your audience to suspend disbelief and
fully experience a fictional reality. The antithesis of commitment is
($)&<1=$’). Detachment makes the audience aware of the artifice of the
scene, drawing attention to the fact that you are a comedian performing
a scene as opposed to a character within the fictional reality of a scene.
Detachment generally comes in one of two forms: unintentional
detachment and ironic detachment.
!"#"$%"$#&"’()*%$’+,-%"$)is the result of improvisers making
choices, but playing them in a half-hearted way. It often comes
down to bad acting. Generally, improvisers guilty of this form of
detachment are simply “telling” and not “showing” an audience their
ideas. One example of unintentional detachment would be a man

playing a petite little girl without adjusting his voice or demeanor.
The improviser “says” he is a little girl but he fails to “be” a little girl.
Another example would be an improviser saying that they just broke
their leg in three places, but failing to limp or show any emotional
response to their injury.
./&"#+)*%$’+,-%"$)means consciously not committing to the reality
of the scene in order to get a laugh. Again, this will take the audience
out of the reality of the scene. This is also referred to as <5==$’)"’!.
The examples from the previous paragraph would be examples of ironic
detachment if the lack of commitment was intentional. Below are some
other examples of ironic detachment:
While commenting will often allow a performer to get a quick laugh,
that laugh will come at the expense of establishing a base reality, which
ultimately will undermine the integrity of the scene. Even a momentary
lapse in commitment can make it difficult for your audience to stay
engaged in the base reality of the scene.
The best improvisers completely commit themselves to their scenes.
You must commit to the character you are playing and your reality, and
never sell it out for a laugh or out of fear of not getting a laugh. The more
you commit to your character and the reality of the scene, the more
engaging the scene will be and the more likely it is that you will discover
what is truly funny about the scene.
In simplest terms, “top of your intelligence” refers to responding
truthfully to any stimulus within a scene. It is about allowing yourself
to have a true, honest emotional response. “Intelligence,” in this case, is
your knowledge of how a human being would react to a given situation.
This requires emotional and social intelligence. Playing at the top of
your intelligence means responding the way a real person would in a
given situation.
The principle of “show, don’t tell” comes into play here. It is not
enough to simply react verbally. In order to truly play at the top of your

intelligence, you will need to react emotionally as well. Marry your
verbal response with an emotional one.
For example, when another character pulls out a gun in a scene
and you are scared of it, you are playing at the top of your intelligence.
When you lovingly embrace your girlfriend upon hearing the news that
she is pregnant, you are playing at the top of your intelligence. When
your character touches something hot and you recoil in pain, you are
playing at the top of your intelligence. When you resentfully get coffee
for your mean boss or a rude customer, you are playing at the top of your
intelligence. It is important to note the above responses are not the only
valid responses to each given scenario. Any real or truthful response that
a person might have in any of these situations would also be considered
a “top of intelligence” response. For instance, in the case of hearing the
news that your girlfriend is pregnant, it is equally valid to respond in
shock or despair.
Commitment and playing at the top of your intelligence helps you to
create a rich base reality for your scene.

EXERCISE: GIVE THE SETUP

INSTRUCTIONS
PART ONE

Two improvisers take the stage.

Instead of receiving a suggestion, every scene will start with the

two improvisers having a conversation as their actual selves. The
improvisers in this scene should focus on playing the sceneina
grounded, realistic, and truthful way. The scene should have a casual
or conversational tone.

A third improviser will stop them if they feels that either improviser

is “performing” or not acting realistically in any way. This third
improviser should be asking themself, “Is this really what either of
these people would say?” in order to find those moments that are not
realistic or genuine.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the
improvisers should back up and play the moment again ina
way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

PART TWO

Now each pair of improvisers will be given a simple, specific, and
relatable scenario or “set-up” to start with (e.g. two parents watching
their kids in a little league game, a second date at a familiar chain
restaurant, etc.).

Again, the improvisers should play close to themselves in these scenes.
Their focus should once again be on playing themselves in a grounded,
realistic, and truthful way.

A third improviser should look to stop the scene any time either
performer in the scene is not acting realistically.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers should
back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

PART THREE

Now each pair should be given the suggestion of two character
archetypes that will be different from their actual selves, but within
the realm of possibility in real life (e.g. two astronauts, the Pope anda
Cardinal, the President and the First Lady, etc.).



CHAPTER TWO + How to Create a Base Reality

The goal of both players in these scenes is to play these character
archetypes in the same grounded, realistic, and truthful manner
that they played themselves in Part One.

The third improviser looking to stop the scene can judge the
success of this part of the exercise by considering how closely these
scenes resemble the tone and execution of those scenes in Part
One. Again, the third improviser should stop the scene any time
either performer in the scene is not acting realistically.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers
should back up and play the moment again in a way that is
more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

PART FOUR

For the final section of this exercise, each pair should be given the
suggestion of two character archetypes that are so fundamentally
different from their actual selves that they could not “be” them in
real life. These character archetypes should require the improvisers
to alter their voices and physicality (e.g. two elderly people, two
Russian immigrants, etc.).

Again, the goal of both players in these scenes is to play these
characters in the same, grounded, realistic, and truthful manner that
they played themselves in Part One.

While the improvisers will need to adopt a character voice or
different way of moving in these scenes, they should make these
traits as realistic as they can.

The third improviser can once again judge the success of this part of
the exercise by looking for how closely these scenes resemble the
tone and execution of those scenes in Part One. This third improviser
should now be asking, “Is this really what either of these types of
people would say or do in real life?” in order to find those moments
that are not realistic or genuine.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers
should back up and play the moment again in a way that is
more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.



ADDITIONAL TIPS

Start your scenes “in the middle.” That means initiating with a
specific statement and assuming or labeling a relationship from the
start. Starting your scenes “in the middle” is a good idea in general.

Remember the lessons from the “TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE”
exercise. In real life, you usually don’t just talk about whatever it is
that you are doing as you are doing it. You usually talk about lots of
other things: work, your family, your friends, interests, etc. Use the
scenes in this exercise as an opportunity to practice doing this. The
third improviser watching these scenes should stop the scene if the
improvisers get trapped into talking about what they are doing.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to focus on
playing the reality of the scene in a believable way. If you are able
to successfully portray characters and situations that feel real and
grounded, the absurd element of the scene will stand out better in
contrast. It is easier to recognize the unusual in a scene if we begin
our scenes with a familiar situation or recognizable reality.

This exercise also reinforces that our ideas for scenes do not have to
be crazy, wacky, forced or complicated at the start. In fact, starting
with the familiar increases our odds of finding a first unusual thing.



CHAPTER TWO + How to Create a Base Reality

EXERCISE: WOULD YOU?

INSTRUCTIONS
Have two improvisers take the stage.

Do a series of two-person scenes where the suggestion must
be an emotionally charged scenario (e.g. finding out you have
cancer, being involved in a robbery, going on a first date, etc.).

Video-record these scenes.
As a group, watch each scene.

Stop line-by-line and ask the improviser in the scene variations
on the question, “Would you...?” in relation to their action and
dialogue (e.g. “Would you have really reacted that way to a
person in real life?”)

Each answer should be an honest assessment of whether or
not they were successful in giving their character realistic
human behavior.

Whenever the question is answered with some version of “No,”
discuss other options this improviser had in that scene.

PURPOSE

This exercise is a great way to consider how you are reacting in

Analyzing your scene work in the moment is extremely difficult.
Watching scenes on videotape after the fact allows you to step
outside of your own performance and really focus on your
tendencies as a performer.

Denial

DEFINITION

Denial means failing to agree with any aspect of

the reality established by your scene partner. You should look at every
contribution that your scene partner makes to the scene as a gift. If you



acknowledge and build upon these gifts, your job of finding a scene will
be easier.
Failing to agree with whatever your partner is trying to establish
about your scene can happen in many different ways at the beginning
of a scene. When it does, it puts you and your scene partner in a very
difficult position in terms of building a successful, funny scene.
There are many different forms of denial. One classic example of denial
is the ?>--"’!%)1$%/>! out denial. Let’s look at an example:
Player 2 has done something worse here than failing to add information
to the start of the scene. Player 2 has “pulled the rug out” from under
Player 1 and actively destroyed the information he has just been given%
+)1$%"($&%)1&)%1$%"2%&%?&)"$’)%&’(%)1&)%,-&.$/%A%"2%&%(5<)5/@. This is the
antithesis of Yes And, wherein information is created. Not only are
the improvisers back at square one, but they must now also deal with
the fact that Player 1 must be crazy or a liar for pretending to be a
doctor. Player 2 has denied himself and his scene partner the chance to
organically discover something unusual in their scene. The worst thing
about this denial is that it ruins what could have been a great idea from
Player 1. Denying your scene partners will make it impossible for you to
build trust with them.
Out of nervousness, many new improvisers will force something
unusual to happen at the start of a scene to get a laugh. One of the
quickest, cheapest, and easiest ways to make your audience laugh is to
make your scene partner seem crazy. Playing like this will make the
rest of your scene more difficult to perform, and it will turn you into an
improviser with whom nobody wants to play.
J$"’!%"’&))$’)"#$ is a more mild form of denial. It involves poor
listening and a failure to acknowledge what your scene partner has
established about the scene. “Being inattentive” denials are less
intentional than “pulling the rug out,” but they are just as damaging to
the start of the scene.

When you are inattentive, you can miss important details, such as the
gender, age, or name of the character your scene partner is playing. You
could also miss important information about the character of the space.
For instance, if your scene partner steps out shivering and you fail
to acknowledge that it is cold, you are denying an aspect of your reality
+)1&)%")%"2%<5-(@ being provided to you by your scene partner. This will
likely force some sort of explanation and take your focus away from
establishing the base reality of your scene.
Another common form of denial is referred to as (>$-"’!%"’")"&)"5’2. In
this form of denial, one of the improvisers refuses to let go of his or her
pre-conceived idea. They are unnecessarily forcing a new element into
the scene instead of building upon what their scene partner has offered
up. Here is a Dueling Initiations Example: Two improvisers doing a two-
person scene off of the suggestion “office.”

In this example, Player 2 has acknowledged the information established
by Player 1 while also adding in new information. The problem is that
this new information does not build upon anything established by the
scene initiation. Instead, Player 2 has rejected Player 1’s idea in favor
of his own. Instead of steamrolling with a new idea, Player 2 should be
looking to Yes And the specific base reality offered in the first line.
If you deny the contributions of your scene partner, you run the risk
of confusing your audience. Remember that in Long Form, we are
starting each scene in a blank space, a void without costumes or a
set. Given the lack of visual information, the audience is logically
going to latch onto and invest in whatever the improvisers establish
as the reality of the scene. A denial at the start of a scene is confusing
because it creates competing realities instead of a single reality that
you have built together.
The danger of denial extends beyond the obvious, practical pitfall
of confusing your audience. Denial that flies in the face of information
established by an initiation is often the product of a conscious choice.
Conscious choices like these often feel pushed or forced, especially at
the beginning of the scene. They are also usually just not as interesting
as the unusual thing that you would eventually discover with your scene
partner. An unusual thing that you discover with someone else will
always be more satisfying and much more fun to play with.
Don’t be tempted by the quick, easy laughs that you will sometimes
get from denial. You will be distinguishing yourself as a bad teammate
in exchange for these laughs. An improviser that relies on the sort of
cheap laughs you might get from a denial is like a basketball player that
does nothing but score by taking the ball away from the point guard on
his own team. When you deny your scene partner, you make them feel
cheated and unsupported. Single laughs coming from a denial will be at
the expense of consistent laughs later in the scene.
Making the game of your scene a denial is not the same as building a
scene with your scene partner. If you try to make every scene like this,
you have nothing more than a gimmick.
If your scene partner establishes the Who, What, or Where before you
do so in a scene, always drop your idea and go with theirs. Holding onto
your own ideas about the context of the scene could lead you to deny
your scene partner. Holding onto your own idea is also likely to create
confusion and disconnect between you and your fellow improviser.
Simply agreeing about the base reality of the scene is far more important
than the specifics of the reality itself. In the end, the memorable part

of the scene is not going to be the base reality of the scene (the Who,
What, and Where). The memorable part of the scene will be the funny
thing you discover that breaks from this base reality you and your scene
partner have created.
There is never a good reason to deny any aspect of the reality that
your scene partner has established. Denying your scene partner may
occasionally get a laugh, but it ultimately prevents you from finding a
strong, successful, funny scene.
We are now ready to move on to the “funny” part of the scene. As you
can see, an awful lot goes into the base reality of any scene. In many
ways, the success of a Long Form scene as a whole rides on what
happens in those first few lines.
You may feel overwhelmed at this point. Realize that this is a natural
part of the learning process. The only way you will ever own these
concepts is through lots of practice and repetition. You shouldn’t have
a disregard for the rules as you learn them; you should look to practice
them so much that you no longer find them overwhelming.
The many “rules” discussed for the beginning of the scene tend to
overwhelm new improvisers who are attempting to follow them all,
in the moment, while creating a scene. According to Del Close, to be
an improviser, one must be a juggler. Improvers have to be actors,
directors, and editors all at once. You are handling all of these skills
at once and you must also have a sense of where your scene could be
going. Inevitably, you are always carrying a little bit of baggage in some
part of your brain while you are improvising.
The challenge is to never let this baggage block the moment you’re
in. With repeated practice, the rules and instructions described as
being essential to the beginning of the scene do start to become second
nature. As this happens, you should find it easier and easier to truly “be
in the moment.”
Think back to when you first learned to ride a bike. Learning how to
ride was originally quite daunting. New bike riders are making constant
minor adjustments just to keep from falling over, and in spite of these
constant adjustments, new bike riders can expect to fall over many
times. However, once you finally learn how to ride, doing so becomes—
and usually remains—effortless. Keeping all of the rules straight when
doing your first Long Form scenes is very much like those first bike
rides, in which you had to consciously think about steering, pedaling,
and keeping balanced all at once. Right now, it is just important to
realize that time and practice will eventually make following the rules
more automatic.

The Game
of the Scene
In this section we introduce you to the concept of “the game of the
scene.” The game of the scene is the core of the UCB’s teaching. We
first started using the word “game” to describe the central funny idea of
our improv scenes while studying in Chicago. When we set up our own
classes in New York, we started developing the idea further. Now we see
game as the foundation of all comedy, and finding and playing game as
the primary goal of improvised comedy.
We developed most of the tools and terms in this section to help
students focus on finding and playing game to make their improv scenes
clear, focused, and funny.
This section contains a lot of what comprises the UCB style of improv.
As we’ve said before, game generally starts with an unusual thing
relative to the base reality. We talk about the concept of framing, a
term we use to describe how improvisers help each other notice when
something is unusual.
We introduce the idea of organic scenes and premise scenes.
Organic scenes start from just a suggestion, and use “Yes And” to

build a world and find an unusual thing. A premise scene depends
on the opening of a longform to provide a first unusual thing before
the scene begins. Premise scenes begin right away with an unusual
thing—shortening or eliminating the Yes And phase, and getting right
to the game.
We show you how to play the game once you’ve found one, using
heightening and exploring. Heightening is when you repeat and expand
what’s unusual. Exploring is when the characters give top-of-their-
intelligence reasons for doing unusual behavior.
We talk about the mechanics of various support moves players can
do to add to the games of scenes they were not in at the beginning.
We dispel some common misconceptions, and expand our
understanding of Yes And, agreement, and listening.
We explain that even when scenes become very absurd, we still use
top-of-your-intelligence reactions, good listening, strong commitment,
and supportive teamwork to ensure good scene work.

In this chapter we
define the game of the
scene, explaining that
it is the central funny
idea of a comedy sketch
or scene. If you name
what’s funny about a
scene, that’s the game.
Plot is often irrelevant.
We explain that
the game is often a
pattern. You want to
continue that pattern
to play the game.

Naming
the Game
Think of your favorite written comedy sketch. Now try to sum up what
is funny about that sketch in just a few words. That is “the game” of that
particular sketch. Let’s distill two classical sketches from the influential
late ’60s-early ’70s British comedy troupe Monty Python down to their
games. In the “Cheese Shop” sketch, a befuddled patron attempts to buy
cheese from the proprietor of a cheese shop who, while claiming to have
cheese, literally has no cheese for sale. The game of this sketch could
be described as “specialty shop that does not sell what it claims to sell.”
In “The Parrot Sketch,” an angry customer attempts to return a dead
parrot to the owner of a pet shop who refuses to acknowledge that the
parrot is dead. The game of this sketch could be described as “refusal to
acknowledge an irrefutable fact.”
Let’s imagine a sketch in which a woman comes home to find her
husband in bed with another woman. The husband refuses to admit
that he is cheating in spite of the obvious evidence to the contrary. This
sketch would essentially have the same game as “The Parrot Sketch”
(refusal to acknowledge an irrefutable fact).
Notice that in both of the previous examples, the games were
described without either of the specifics one would be most likely to
associate with each sketch (“cheese” and “parrot,” respectively). We did
not describe the game of “The Parrot Sketch” as “man returns a dead
parrot,” because that description resembles a plot synopsis. Comedic
Improv is not achieved by creating a plot or story. It is achieved by
creating a game.
The Who, What, and Where are the elements that make up the plot
of the scene. The plot is not what is funny about the scene. Our style of
Long Form improvisation is not about plot or story. What is funny is the
game, a pattern that is played within the context of that Who, What, and
Where. If you strip away the specifics (the Who, What and Where) of
any successful sketch or scene, you should still be able to describe the
game of a scene, and you’ll probably be able to set it in a new context,
as we have done with “The Parrot Sketch.” This is because the game of
the scene is not beholden to the specifics of the scene. The specifics are
there to support the game.

Once you and your scene partner have established the base reality of
your scene, you are ready to find and play the game of the scene. Again,
the game is what is funny about your scene. It is a consistent pattern of
behavior that breaks from the expected patterns of our everyday lives.
You and your partner will work together to discover “the funny” of your
scene. Once it is found, you will heighten and explore “the funny” for the
rest of the scene.
The key to finding and playing the game is identifying the first
unusual thing in a scene, the first piece of information that breaks
from the pattern of normal life. Once this has been discovered, the
improvisers will shift away from “Yes And” and move onto “If…Then”
(Asking the question “If This Unusual Thing Is True, Then What Else Is
True?”). With Yes And, we were agreeing with information presented
and adding new information to develop a base reality. Once the unusual
thing has been found, we no longer need to develop a base reality; we
need to be funny. Repeatedly answering the question “If this unusual
thing is true, then what else is true?” creates a comic pattern. Each
answer to this question (or similar, related versions of this question) is
called a “game move.” A combination of game moves forms a pattern
that we call a “game.”

The game of the scene requires building funny patterns of behavior
in scenes. To help you understand how game helps improvisers to build
scenes, think of forming a pattern with numbers.
Let’s say you started a series of numbers like this:
3 will represent the first unusual thing in a scene.
Then imagine the first game move is the number 6.
At this point, the game is still not cemented because we have still not
clearly established a pattern. Imagine that the next game move is 9.
At this point, if you are going to successfully follow this pattern, you
are going to have to “Add 3 to the previous number.” We have already
agreed that “Add 3” is what is funny. The audience also expects to see you
“Add 3.” If you “Add 2” or “Add 5,” it is going to confuse your audience and
it will destroy what you have established.
You can think of the 9 move as “locking” your pattern. From this point
on, we know that we are only going to “Add 3.” Anything else would fall
outside of our pattern or game. Once this pattern has been established,
it must stay the same in order to focus what is funny about the scene.
Now let’s start over:
Now, instead of 9 being the next game move, let’s imagine that the
next game move is 12.
You might describe this game as “Multiply by 2.” In this case, we have
agreed that what is funny is “Multiplying the last number by 2.” (Instead
of having a daunting, limitless number of possibilities, we have a clear
focused pattern to follow.)
Both patterns are completely valid, and they both started from the
same first unusual thing. The same thing will happen with the game of
the Scene. Any number of games can come from the same starting place.

However, once the pattern has been locked, there is no need to stray
from it. There is no need to find more interesting or unusual things.
Think of it this way: if each number in the pattern gets a laugh and you
have to choose another number to contribute, why wouldn’t you choose
what has already worked?
In case the number example confused you, here is another quick
example. In this example, let’s say the first unusual thing is “orange.”
The following are three different patterns that you could create from the
same starting place:
• orange, blue, yellow (colors)
• orange, pineapple, apple (fruits)
• orange, baseball, globe (round objects)
In both of the abstract number examples in the previous section, each
new number represents another funny moment in a scene. In order to
continue to make each scene funny, you will still have to come up with
new numbers. However, thanks to the game, your thought process isn’t
all over the place. You’ll be thinking of certain numbers instead of all
numbers. A major benefit of game is that you know what works, so you
don’t need to be wildly creative. The narrowing down of limitless
possibilities in this way makes the task of being funny infinitely easier.
With a game, you put boundaries on what choices you could be making
and in doing so, lighten your cognitive load.

The game makes being funny in a Long Form scene easier by forcing
you to focus on a single comic idea. Its nature is to take away options so
that you and your scene partner don’t have to keep searching for new
unusual, funny things. Having a game in your scene is the closest thing
in improvisation to having a script. You don’t have to wrack your brain
for funny things to say. You now have a method that provides you with
funny things to say. The method is asking the question “if this unusual
thing is true, then what else is true?” to build your scene off of your
initial funny discovery.
Sports can serve as a great analogy for the game. Think of game as
the sport you choose to play. If you agree to play basketball with other
people, you all know that there are certain rules that will be followed
and certain things you can expect to happen (e.g. you must dribble the
ball if you want to move with it). If anyone were to deviate from these
rules or constantly make up new rules (the equivalent of throwing
random unusual things into the scene), the game would no longer be fun
to play or watch. The game would fall apart.
You may be thinking that following rules in improv will be
constraining. However, following the rules of a game in an improv scene
is no more constraining than following the rules in a game of basketball.
As is the case with basketball, there is an inexhaustible amount of
variation within the rules. Even though there are rules, the specific
way you play while adhering to those rules is never predetermined.
Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Shaquille O’Neal all played the same
game with the same rules, yet they all had completely different styles.
Similarly, there is plenty of room for individual expression within the
constraints of the game of the scene. The game is just giving you a
structure within which you can be creative.
You could also think of performing a successful Long Form scene as
trying to get from one side of a forest to the other. Without a clear-cut
path, you and your scene partner could encounter heavy brush, mud,
or any number of other things that would make getting to the other
side very difficult. You might disagree about the best way to get to other
side, and this could keep you from working together. A path would
make the task of getting from one side of the forest to the other much
easier to accomplish. Game is the path leading you and your scene
partner through the forest of a Long Form scene. The path provided
by the game makes performing a Long Form scene with someone else
effortless and enjoyable.
Now that we have defined what game is and why it is important, it is
time to move on to how to find it.

Finding
Game

We cover a lot in this chapter.
That’s because the concept
of finding a game in a scene
involves the very important
skill of noticing what's funny,
and agreeing on it—without
planning beforehand. There
are a lot of tools we suggest
to let games flourish while
also playing scenes with
commitment and top of your

Topics covered:

Organic scenes, which are inspired by
an audience suggestion; and premise
scenes, which are inspired by the
opening of a longform

Framing, when players call attention to
the first unusual thing

Yes And becomes less important after you
find a game

Even when characters are disagreeing the
improvisers are still in agreement

things are unusual

Types of premise initiations: premise,
half-idea, and chaff

A premise doesn’t become a game until it’s

Organic vs.
Premise
There are two ways that improvisers can go about finding the game: by
performing Organic Scenes or Premise Scenes. In an Organic Scene,
the first unusual or interesting thing will be found during the course
of the scene. In a Premise Scene, the first unusual or interesting thing
is found in information generated before the scene begins in a Long
Form “opening” !"#$%&’()’*+"&,$--&.*&/$%’0%%*/&$)&/*"1$-&-1"*23. Premise
Scenes begin with an initiation that implies a base reality and a first
unusual thing.

In both Organic and Premise scenes, the pattern or game will be
found during the course of the scene. Let’s go back to our number
examples. We saw two different patterns spring from the same first
unusual thing !"#*&)04.*2&53. A game couldn’t be fully described until a
few game moves built a pattern off of the number 3. This holds true for
all scenes, no matter how detailed an initiation may be. This is because
you can never know exactly how your scene partner will react to a first
unusual thing. In all two-person scenes (whether they are Organic or
Premise), both improvisers will need to work together to determine what
pattern a first unusual thing is part of.
The UCB believes that there is no intrinsic value in how you get
to the first unusual thing in your scene. Organic and Premise scenes
are both equally valid. Compare it to conducting an interview. You
can sit down and start talking until you find something interesting to
talk about, or you can have a pre-interview and determine what you
want to talk about ahead of time. Both approaches could yield equally
successful final results.
There is nothing wrong with starting with something as simple as a
Who, What or Where and building a great scene from there. There is also
nothing wrong with an initiation that clearly establishes a reality and a
first unusual thing, as long as this first unusual thing is derived from an
opening. The comedy of the scene will come from what follows these
initial choices. Once again, no matter how intricate of a premise the
first line of the scene may contain, the game that follows will always be
different from what either improviser could have predicted or expected.

Finding
the Game
Organically
Since the game is what is funny about a scene, finding the game is
your primary goal as an improviser. Finding the game organically
begins with identifying the “first unusual thing” in an organic
scene. Organic scenes will begin with one of the two improvisers
establishing something about the relationship, activity, or location
in order to begin building the base reality of a scene. In order to
get to a first unusual thing, both improvisers will need to use Yes
And to get a full sense of the base reality. Once the base reality is
established, both improvisers should be listening for anything that
would be unusual, interesting, or out of the ordinary given this
context. The first unusual thing should always stand out in contrast
to the base reality.
Don’t put pressure on yourself to be funny in the very first line of an
organic scene. In other words, don’t force the first unusual thing. You
and your scene partner will need to take a few lines to Yes And each
other until the first unusual thing is found.
Once the first unusual thing has been discovered, the improvisers
will shift away from Yes And and move onto asking the question “If This
Unusual Thing Is True, Then What Else Is True?” Once we have used this
question to create a pattern from the first unusual thing, we have found
our game.
Framing means letting your scene partner know that you feel that they
have said or done something unusual within the context of the base
reality. When you frame, you highlight or underline the unusual so that
it stands out to your scene partner.
One of the simplest ways to frame the unusual is to simply react with
an exclamation as soon as you hear the first unusual thing. We do this
all the time in real life when presented with something unusual !*676&

EXAMPLE 1

PLAYER 1: “I think Timmy is making strides in art class, but he
is still having difficulty with social interactions.”

PLAYER 2: “I think like many great artists, he finds mundane,
everyday interactions difficult.”

PLAYER 1: “What?”

Another way to frame the unusual it is to react honestly to what
has happened.

EXAMPLE 2

PLAYER 1: “I think Timmy is making strides in art class, but he
is still having difficulty with 2social interactions.”

PLAYER 2: “I think like many great artists, he finds mundane,
everyday interactions difficult.”

PLAYER 1: “I think he’s a little young to be labeled a
great artist.”


CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

A father that considers his young son to be a great artist stood out as
unusual to Player 1. By simply reacting as he or she would in reality
upon hearing this information, Player 1 framed the unusual for Player 2.

Another possibility is to have your character agree and add specifics
that make what you’ve found to be unusual clear.

EXAMPLE 3

PLAYER 1: “I think Timmy is making strides in art class, but he
is still having difficulty with social interactions.”

PLAYER 2: “I think like many great artists, he finds mundane,
everyday interactions difficult.”

PLAYER 1: “Il agree that his stick figures are striking examples
of minimalism, but he does need to get along with
the other children.”

By adding a specific that made it clear that the child’s artistic ability is
merely age-appropriate (drawing stick figures) while still agreeing that
the child is exceptional, Player 1 showed Player 2 that he felt the unusual
thing was considering a young child to be a great artist.

At the start of an Organic scene, both improvisers are unsure of
when they will reach their first unusual thing. Be sure to use framing as
a way to ensure that you and your scene partner are ready to shift from
Yes And to If Then at the same time.

EXAMPLES OF GAME IN ORGANIC SCENES
Let’s look at an example of finding the game in an Organic scene.

EXAMPLE 1

Two improvisers are given the suggestion “blind date.”
[PLAYER 1 pulls out two chairs and places them across from each other.
Player 1 sits in one chair and gestures for Player 2 to sit in the other.]

PLAYER 1: “Wow, it’s getting late.”
PLAYER 2: “Yeah, it’s already 10 P.M.”

PLAYER 1: “This blind date is lasting way longer than |
thought it would.”

PLAYER 2: “What are you talking about? We just got
our dessert.”



The players have established a reality, and identified the first unusual
thing in four lines. The characters in this scene are in a restaurant, and
have just finished their main course.
Player 1 provided the first unusual thing in their second line. This
line is unusual because it is not something you would actually say out
loud to someone with whom you are having a first date. Player 1’s second
line is the starting point for the rest of the comedy in this scene.
Player 2’s second line “frames” Player 1’s second line as the first
unusual thing with exclamation, “What are you talking about?”, and also
adds the new information, “We just got our dessert.”, which serves to
make the unusualness of what Player 2 has just said more specific. This
new information lets us know that what Player 1 has just said is unusual,
not only because it’s not something one would normally say on a first
date, but also because the date has not in fact been inordinately long.
Having clearly identified the first unusual thing with Player 2’s second
line, the next line from Player 1 will determine the pattern this unusual
thing is part of. In other words, this is where we will find the game of
this scene.
With the above line, Player 1 has given a clear indication to Player 2
of the game they would like to play. By stating that they think the date
is going “way too fast”, when in fact they have only just gotten dessert,
Player 1 is suggesting a game you might describe as, “A blind date in
which one person has a pathological fear of commitment”.

At first glance, Player 2’s third line above might appear to be a simple
top-of-intelligence reaction, but because it provides new information
in keeping with the game of the scene, it is in fact a game move. Player
2 made this game move by asking the question, “If this unusual thing
is true, then what else is true?” More specifically, they asked, “If Player
1 has a pathological fear of commitment, then what is true about their
concern that ‘moving on’ to dessert is indicative of things ‘moving
way too fast’?” The answer to this question is that the concern is likely
unfounded. So Player 2 makes the choice that their desserts were
included as part of their dinner specials, so that, even if “moving on
to” dessert was a sign of things moving too fast, they in fact did not
“move on to” it, because dessert was included with their dinners, and
therefore it can’t be interpreted as a sign of things moving too fast. This
line makes it clear to Player 1 that Player 2 understands the game Player
1 suggested playing in the previous line. Notice that even though Player
1 is a Voice of Reason in this scene, they have already found a way to
make a game move, and not simply react to Player 2’s game moves.
At this point, both improvisers are playing the game of their scene,
which we can describe as “A blind date in which one person has a
pathological fear of commitment.” They can now adhere to this pattern
of behavior to play this game for the rest of their scene.
As we explained earlier, it is not the first unusual thing itself,
but rather the information the players choose to add to the scene
immediately after its introduction, that establishes the game of the
scene, creating a pattern in which the first unusual thing exists.
Let’s go back to the start of our example scene and find a different
game by responding differently to the first unusual thing.
Two improvisers are given the suggestion “blind date.”

This example starts with the same three lines in which Player 1
provides the first unusual thing with their second line, “This blind date
is lasting way longer than I thought it would.”
However, in this example, instead of Player 2 framing the first
unusual thing with their second line, they used their second line to
actually start the game. Player 2 asked themselves the If Then question,
“If this other character is saying that the date is going way longer than
they thought it would, then what is going on?” They decided the answer
was that the date was indeed going on too long, and that it was their
character’s fault, stemming from their having become far too attached
to the other character over the course of one date than is warranted.
With their second line, Player 2 suggested a game you might describe as
“The unwarranted acceleration 0f a relationship”.
Player 1 responded to Player 2’s “game move” by grounding the scene
with logic. Player 1 shines a light on the unusualness of Player 2’s
deciding that Player 1 is “the one” by reminding us that the two of them
are on a blind date, and therefore have only just met.
Player 2 then used Player 1’s pointing out that they have only just
met as an opportunity to play the game of the scene, deciding that this

fact, combined with the fact that Player 2 feels that Player 1 is “the one”,
means that this date is a case of “Love at first sight!”.
Player 1 and Player 2 will continue to play this game of “The
unwarranted acceleration 0f a relationship” by following the patterns
of behavior that have been established. Player 2 will continue to make
game moves that attempt to accelerate their relationship. Player 1 will
continue to be reasonable and grounded.
Yes And is considered to be one of the most fundamental precepts
of Long Form improvisation. However, many new improvisers are
confused by this concept and erroneously bring it into the game
section of the scene. While Yes And is extremely important at the start
of Organic scenes, overly focusing on Yes And once you have reached
the game section of your scene can cause things to get unnecessarily
complicated. In the base reality section of the scene, improvisers must
Yes And each other until they find their game. In the game section of
the scene, improvisers switch from Yes And to If Then.
Also note that there is no abstract value to a “fuller” or “larger”
base reality. There is no merit in having the process of Yes Anding that
establishes the base reality take a long time. The purpose of Yes And is
not to establish the most complex, in-depth base reality possible. You
want to use Yes And to establish a base reality and find the first unusual
thing as efficiently as possible. You will find the first unusual thing
efficiently if you remember to Yes And in a specific and personal way.
Drawing upon your own unique opinions and life experiences when Yes
Anding will help you get to a satisfying game quickly.

You have probably used the flash in conversations without
even knowing it. Let’s say you’re at a party, and someone says,
“I grew up in Nebraska.” Your brain flashes to memories of doing
summer stock theater in a small town in Nebraska. This flash
includes memories of staying up all night drinking, and sleeping
all day until showtime in order to deal with the boredom of small
town Nebraska. This flash all happens in an instant, and you
reply, “Oh, | did summer stock theater in Nebraska one summer.”

The flash will always provide interesting, unexpected specifics,
personal to you, that you can use in your Yes Anding. Why is
the flash so reliable in this way? We come into this world as
blank slates, so, one way or another, everything in our brain is
something we’ve remembered from past experiences. Yet we have
a limited storage capacity in our brains. Therefore, our brains don’t
catalog mundane, business-as-usual information. They catalog
things that are unexpected, unusual, and pattern-breaking.

So a flash is valuable for Yes Anding for two reasons. One, it
contains interesting, specific information. Two, that information
is necessarily related to the previous line, since that is what
provoked it.

So let’s imagine that you, the same person who spent the
summer in Nebraska doing summer stock, are an improviser. You’re
on stage with another improviser, who initiates “I can’t believe we
have to spend the whole summer in Nebraska.”

This would very likely inspire the same flash to your experiences of
doing summer stock in a small town in Nebraska. But instead of simply
responding, “I did summer stock theater in Nebraska one summer,”
you would use the specifics from your flash in your response.

You might reply, “Dude, we’re here to do summer stock! That
means we get to act, get drunk, and mess with townies! Let’s get
high and take our minds off Nebraska!” This flash-inspired Yes
Anding has added the specifics that the characters in the scene are
actors, and at least one of them likes to get drunk, do drugs, and
give the locals a hard time. You may, in fact, have your first unusual
thing, since you might expect that people who do summer stock do
it for artistic reasons, yet this guy seems equally interested in doing
it in order to get drunk, take drugs, and mess with people.

Compare that to this non-specific, non-personal response to “I
can’t believe we have to spend the whole summer in Nebraska”:
“Yeah, the summers get crazy hot here!” That line also Yes Ands the
previous line, but does not move you any closer to an unusual thing.



CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

EXERCISE: USING THE
“FLASH” TO YES AND

INSTRUCTIONS

* Two improvisers take the stage. One or more improvisers watch
the exercise and offer feedback as needed.

* Improviser 1 gets a one-word suggestion and initiates with a
line of dialogue.

Improviser 2 will share out loud the “flash” they have in
response to the line of dialogue. The improviser can share their
flash by saying “That made me think of...,” “I flashed to...,”
“That reminds me of...,” etc.

If Improviser 2 takes too long to report on their flash, they

have allowed the flash to slip by and are now trying to instead
“think” of something related to the line of dialogue. We want the
improviser to report on their unconscious response, not fabricate
a conscious response. If the improviser is struggling to report on
a flash, get a new suggestion and start again.

¢ After sharing their flash, Improviser 2 will then identify out loud
what they think is the most interesting part of their flash. If they
misidentify the interesting part of the flash, have them try again.

¢ Next, Improviser 2 Yes Ands with a line of dialogue that includes
the most interesting part of the flash.

¢ Ifthe improviser fails to include the most interesting part of the
flash, or fails to Yes And the preceding line, have them try again.

Example of a response that uses the interesting part of the flash,
but doesn’t Yes And:

First line: “I can’t believe we have to spend the
whole summer in Nebraska.”

Response: “I did summer stock in Nebraska one
summer. All| did was act, get drunk, and
mess with townies.”



Same information used to Yes And the previous line:

First line: “I can’t believe we have to spend the
whole summer in Nebraska.”

Response: “Dude, we’re here to do summer stock.
That means we get to act, get drunk, and
mess with townies! Let’s get high and
take our minds off Nebraska!”

Improviser 1 will then go through the same process in response
to Improviser 2’s line.

The exercise will continue back and forth in this manner until one
of the improvisers decides that the other has delivered a line of
dialogue that contains the “first unusual thing,” at which point
they should deliver a line of dialogue that frames the first unusual
thing. If you are doing the exercise well, you will almost never
have to go past three total lines to find the first unusual thing.

One way you will know that you have identified the first unusual
thing is if you find you aren’t really reporting on a flash in
response to a line, but are instead saying something like “That
makes me think | want to ask you ‘why would you do that?” or
“That makes me think that that doesn’t make sense.”

PURPOSE

¢ This exercise is meant to help you Yes And efficiently and find the
first unusual thing as quickly as possible so you can get to the
entertaining part of the scene, the game.

It also helps you become conscious of your uniqueness and bring
it to your art. Your personal take on things, formed by the life
you’ve lived, is the one thing you have that nobody else does. We
can all avail ourselves of the same methods and rules of improv,
so it’s bringing your personal take on things to bear on your work
that will set you apart from others.

If you practice this technique enough, the process of using what
you flash to in your Yes And responses becomes second nature,
and something you do almost unconsciously.



Yes And isn’t the only source of confusion when it comes to playing
game. New improvisers also get very confused about the concept of
agreement when it comes to finding and playing game in Organic
scenes. This is because they have trouble understanding the idea that
there are always two levels of communication going on during an
improv scene. One level is between the two improvisers performing the
scene; the other is between the two fictional characters being portrayed
by the improvisers.
The improvisers must always come to an agreement about the game
that they are playing in their scene. This does not mean that the two
fictional characters must agree on everything said in their dialogue.

The improvisers will come to agreement about their reality, what they
have found to be unusual, and how they are going to heighten and
explore this unusual thing. The characters are simply going to behave
in a way that will support and sustain this pattern of unusual behavior,
even if that means the characters disagree with each other. Improvisers
are always agreeing; characters are not.
Let’s return to some examples from earlier to highlight agreement that
serves the scene:
The line in red is an example of an improviser agreeing and a character
disagreeing. Player 2’s character clearly does not agree that the blind
date is lasting unusually long, but by reacting to information that stands
out as unusual, the improviser has come to agreement with Player 1.
%Z#A!"%’:’ [W&#ADQR]’
In this example from our section on framing, the character being
portrayed by Player 1 doesn’t pretend that blowing up half of an
audience is normal. The character reacts to the information by
questioning it in the line in red. By reacting at the top of their
intelligence, this !"#$%&!’($)comes to agreement with Player 2 about
what is happening in this scene.

Let’s look at one new example to illustrate how agreement between the
fictional characters and agreement between the improvisers differ in
the service of finding a game:
You and your scene partner are given the suggestion “ledge.” Your scene
partner steps out and initiates physically by pantomiming that he is
standing on a ledge. He says, “Please, push me off the ledge. I have
nothing left to live for.”
This improviser doesn’t really want you to push him off the ledge.
What he wants you to do is talk him out of suicide. If you push him off
the ledge, you are saying “Yes” to his character’s request instead of the
improviser’s implicit request, which is, “start talking me off the ledge.”
You should be thinking, “What does this other improviser want?” In
order to agree with what the other improviser has initiated, you must
say “no” to the character’s request and instead start talking him down,
or whatever you would do in this situation.
Pushing your scene partner off of the ledge would be very unusual.
By saying “no” to this request, you have said “yes” to the reality of the
scene, making it easier for both of you to recognize the first unusual
thing later in this scene.

Once you have found a game, you are agreeing to play this game and
this game only in your scene. You must agree with each other in order
to play game together. Both improvisers will do this by asking, “If this
unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” Every time you or your
scene partner use this question to play within this pattern, you are
agreeing with each other.
Listening is also extremely important when finding the game
organically in a scene. Poor listening puts you at risk for missing the
first unusual thing in your scene. Failing to identify the first unusual
thing will delay you from finding a game, which in turn may cause you
to feel the need to force an unusual thing by saying randomly weird or
clever things. If you are listening, you will be able to identify the very
first unusual thing that occurs. Listening helps you to find and play a
game as soon as possible.
New improvisers often fail to listen because they are searching so
desperately for the game of the scene in their own head. You shouldn’t
have to search hard for the game because it lies in your scene partner.
Either your scene partner will provide the unusual thing or frame what
you have said, identifying it as unusual. You will only be able to find the
game if you truly listen to the specific choices and information being
provided to you by your scene partner. Your game is waiting for you
there, not in your own thoughts or clever ideas.
Like listening, playing at the top of your intelligence is a principle of
scene work that must be employed for the entirety of a Long Form scene.
Playing at the top of your intelligence and addressing the first unusual
thing in a scene at the moment it is introduced will start the game, the
pattern that will be made out of this funny behavior or concept. If your
scene partner introduces something unusual and you fail to react at the
top of your intelligence, you have introduced something !"#!$unusual.
Now the audience is watching a silly scene with no grounded reality
from which to grow. If your scene partner makes a bold move after the
game has been found, they still need you to react. They want you to play
at the top of your intelligence so that you can both focus on and extend
the comedy being provided by your game.
Playing at the top of your intelligence is often absent in scenes
where improvisers have misunderstood the principles of agreement
and Yes And. You are more likely to discover what the other improviser
wants in a scene if you simply react at the top of your intelligence to
their character’s actions or words. Remember, you want to Yes And the
scene, not literally everything the improviser says. We want to agree

with the improviser, not agree
with the character.
Let’s take a closer look at
how playing at the top of
your intelligence factors
into playing the game of the
scene. We have established
that playing at the top of your
intelligence is about reacting
and staying committed to the
character you are building
through these reactions. But
how do you know *%+)to react
in a scene?
Reacting in an improv
scene is often more
complicated than simply
sharing ,%-$)initial internal
response to a stimulus. In
improv, you can’t just share
your gut reaction, because
you wouldn’t in real life. We
don’t let out every impulse
and unadulterated reaction to
the things happening around
us. By taking into account
the circumstances of the
scene and allowing these
circumstances to help you
decide how you will react, the
base reality of your scene will
be more realistic.
In real life, the way
you react to a stimulus is
tempered by your status in
relation to the status of others
and your environment. The
same is true for reacting as
a character in Long Form.
You must always consider
with whom your character is

interacting and where this
interaction is taking place.
You can think of status as
causing you to have a filter
through which your initial
reaction must pass.
In real life, more
often than not, there is
a difference in status
between two people. You
talk differently to your
boss than you talk to your
wife, son, garbage man,
etc. Establishing and
respecting status in a scene
is important. How someone
speaks to you will always
cause some sort of specific
internal reaction no matter
who says it. However,
the manner in which you
express your reaction after
it has passed through your
filter depends in part on the
status of the person with
whom you are dealing.
Let’s look at how using this
concept of a filter in regards
to the character status could
cause you to have wildly
different reactions to the
same simple line in a scene:
“Get me a cup of coffee!” No
matter who says it, this line
is likely to cause the same
initial reaction. It is a blunt
command that most people
would find to be rude.
However, considering your
status in relation to the other
character should completely
change your response.
If the other character
is your younger brother,
you might respond by
barking, “Get yourself a cup

of coffee!” Let’s say the other character is an old woman. You might
not want to get her a cup of coffee, and you may still find her way of
asking to be very rude, but you might decide that your character has
respect for the elderly. Maybe you use a subtle facial expression to
show the audience that you are visibly annoyed or surprised, but you
respond by saying, “Okay…how do you take it?” Now let’s imagine
that the other character is your boss. You may definitely .%/)want to
get him a cup of coffee. You might *0/( your boss. However, status is
going to temper your gut reaction. Maybe in this scenario, you simply
let out a subtle sigh of frustration and pour the cup of coffee. Through
a tightly clenched jaw, you respond, “Here you go, boss.” You have
communicated how you really feel to your audience without neglecting
to acknowledge how this scene would play out in reality. Additionally,
by choosing to play low status to your scene partner, you are Yes Anding
his high status initiation.
Environment also tempers your responses and how your character
will react in scenes. If you have established that you are in an apartment,
the line “Hey, wanna make out?” is going to get a different reaction
than it would if you have established that you are in Central Park. Your
character’s internal reaction may be, “Yes, I want to make out” in both
situations, but your character might be more hesitant to act on this
impulse in the middle of Central Park. Now let’s change the environment
to a church. Maybe your character still wants to make out, but you might
flirtatiously respond, “Not here.” Change the environment again: this
time you are in a church at your grandmother’s funeral. Even though
the immediate, internal reaction may be the same, it is easy to imagine
your character offering a response line to show that you are angry or
offended. Since real people act differently if they are in an apartment, a
park, or a church, this aspect of the scene should be taken in account in
a Long Form scene.
Now let’s consider another scenario in which both status and
environment would be taken into consideration. You initiate by
complaining of a terrible toothache. Your character encounters a
homeless person out on the street who offers to hit you with a brick
to knock you out, giving you a respite from the pain. Your immediate
reaction would be to not want to get hit with a brick. This, combined
with your environment 10)$0.2%")3!/,)’/$((/4)and your status in relation
to the other character, is probably going to cause you to outright refuse
this strange offer.
Now let’s change the Who and the Where. You are now in a
dentist’s office. Various degrees and diplomas verifying -./0 dentist’s
qualifications surround you. The dentist enters and you once again
complain about having a terrible toothache. In a calm, authoritative,
and professional-sounding voice, the dentist proposes hitting you with
a brick in order to knock you out, giving you a temporary respite from
the pain. Again, your immediate reaction is probably going to be to not

want to get hit with a brick! However, the environment and status tied
to this scenario may keep you from outright refusing this still strange
offer. After allowing your initial reaction to pass through /*!’ filter, your
character may even seriously consider getting hit with a brick. You are
dealing with someone who has a medical degree. This should certainly
be enough to persuade you to hear the dentist out. Your environment
and your partner’s status as a medical professional has changed how
you would express how you are affected.
Respecting status is ultimately what keeps Long Form improvisers
from always telling their scene partners that they are crazy in
response to the unusual. Allowing your reactions to pass through
filters created by environment and status is what keeps you from
walking out of most scenes. Filters give you a reason to be patient and
hear the other character’s logic.
Status within a scene isn’t only dictated by job title, rank, or age.
Status within a scene is more importantly dictated by the characters’
behavior towards each other. If your scene partner’s boss character
from our earlier example said, “Um, excuse me, Thompson, but, uh, if
it’s not too much trouble…do you think you could please grab me a cup
of coffee?” they are still playing a boss, but a very different status has
been established. This, in turn, will determine how you are affected.
Remember that there isn’t one “correct” reaction for a given situation.
The important thing is that you are affected in some way.
Let’s take a line-by-line look at this scene in the dentist’s office
to illustrate how playing at the top of your intelligence is important
to the game of the scene. Let’s pretend that you are Player 2 in the
following example:
Two improvisers are given the suggestion “x-ray.”

Clearly, Player 1’s line in green is the first unusual thing in this scene.
We can assume that Player 1 knows that this is an unorthodox 10.2)
20.5($%-’4)way to anesthetize a patient. Even though the character
wants you to let him hit you with a brick, the improviser playing this
character wants you to stop him from hitting you with a brick. He wants
you to question his unorthodox methods so that he can explore or
justify his absurd behavior with logic.
The lines in red are examples of playing at the top of your
intelligence. Saying “Hey, hold on a minute” or even “No way!” would
be other examples of playing at the top of your intelligence. You have
chosen to play the voice of reason in this scene. A voice of reason is the
“everyman” in a scene who must deal with absurdity. A voice of reason
is going to react to the unusual as someone in reality would react. By
questioning this unorthodox method, you have grounded the scene and
supported your scene partner’s move by giving it a response that is at the
top of your intelligence.
Saying something like, “You’re not a dentist, you’re my plumber,”
would be an example of the improviser saying “no” to the scene. This is
an example of denial because saying this would be denying what your
scene partner established about the base reality.
If you immediately agree to being hit with a brick, you will have
destroyed the reality of the scene. Your character will have become
as absurd as the doctor. You have essentially said “no” to your scene
partner’s idea and suggested your own through your crazy behavior.
Now you are going to get hit with a brick, and the scene will be over.
Remember, the game is not yet “locked” when you find the first
unusual thing. By playing at the top of your intelligence, you are framing
the unusual and supporting it by making everything else in the scene
real. A single improviser can’t see the game alone. When offering a move
like Player 1 does in the green line, he needs you to react at the top of
your intelligence so his unusual behavior can be justified and explored.
It is important for you to continue to play at the top of your
intelligence throughout the rest of the scene to support the game. Don’t
say no to getting anesthetized with a brick but then yes to a noose three
lines later. It’s like a game of handball. Your scene partner has served
the ball to you hoping that you’ll hit it back to him. If you just let the ball
go by you, the game won’t get played. After you hit the ball back once,
you should be ready to hit it again and again. Let’s return to the scene to
see how you can continue to be affected as a voice of reason without just
saying “no” to getting hit with a brick over and over:

Two improvisers are given the suggestion “x-ray.”
First, since you reacted to the first mention of the brick, you have
set up Player 1 to justify his unusual behavior. Now that he has
supported his unusual behavior with logic, the game we have
found organically has been locked. We can describe the game as
“unorthodox medical procedure.”
You are still playing at the top of your intelligence in the orange
line, but now you have found a way to move the scene along. You aren’t
completely convinced by Player 1, but you are willing to hear him out
based on the fact that he just gave you a reasonable sounding logic for
using bricks to anesthetize patients. It is important to keep in mind
that status implied by title, rank, or age will affect how characters will
behave in scenes. The fact that this procedure is being suggested by a
dentist may change how you choose to be affected. The important thing
is that you continue to play at the top of your intelligence. The specifics
you offered in the orange line can fuel the next move in the pattern of
“unorthodox medical procedure.”

CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

CRAZY TOWN

Fae to be affected can cause you and everything around

you in the scene to seem absurd. When this happens, you and
your partner have entered what Long Form improvisers call crazy
town. In a crazy town scene, there are so many absurd elements
in play that it becomes difficult to distinguish the unusual from
the ordinary. If you cannot focus on one funny pattern in a scene,
your scene can feel scattered and unsatisfying. Like painting blue
paint on a blue canvas, your game will not stand out against the
background of a crazy world. Often, the best way to avoid crazy
town is to be affected by your scene partner’s idea at the top of your
intelligence with a grounded reaction.



CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

EXERCISE: RECOGNIZING
THE FIRST UNUSUAL THING

INSTRUCTIONS
* Two improvisers take the stage.
* Give them a one-word suggestion.

* The improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish
a reality containing a Who, What, and Where.

* The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other until
they discover the first unusual thing.

The rest of your group should watch the scene carefully for the
first unusual thing. Any of the improvisers watching should
raise their hand when they think they see the first unusual
thing. They should be looking for something that is unusual
given the reality that has been established.

¢ Stop the scene when the first hand is raised. This person
should explain what they saw as the first unusual thing. Discuss
this first unusual thing as a group.

It is okay to disagree about what is unusual—some people will
see things that others will miss.

Either have the improvisers resume the scene with the
identified first unusual thing in mind or discuss potential game
moves as a group. Throw out different game moves that could
spring off of that first unusual thing.

PURPOSE

¢ This exercise will help you to develop the skill of recognizing
the first unusual thing. New improvisers often have so much to
think about during a scene that recognizing the first unusual
thing is lost. By watching the scene from the outside, you can
focus solely on the first unusual thing. This is an important part
of your development as an improviser. It is like a basketball
player practicing jump shots outside of game conditions.

¢ For the improvisers in the scene, the benefit of this exercise is
to get practice playing the game of the scene from the point of
the first unusual thing without having to recognize it on their
own. This exercise is more akin to tee-ball, in which young
baseball players are given the experience of hitting a baseball
without having to wait for the right pitch.



EXERCISE: REPEAT THE
FIRST UNUSUAL THING

INSTRUCTIONS
Have two improvisers take the stage.
Give them a one-word suggestion.

The improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish a
reality containing a Who, What, and Where,

The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other until
they discover the first unusual thing.

When either improviser feels that their scene partner may have
introduced the first unusual thing into their scene, they should
repeat the line containing this information back to their scene
partner word for word. This is not done in character. This is the
improviser repeating, word for word, what the other improviser
has said.

The improviser who said the first unusual thing should repeat
the line again. The improviser who identified the first unusual
thing will repeat the line for a second time. The improviser who
originally said the first unusual thing will repeat the line once
more. (The same line should be heard five times in total.)

The scene should then continue forward from this point. Now
that the first unusual thing has been clearly identified, the
improvisers can react to it, establishing a pattern that will set
the game into motion.

Both improvisers are responsible for making clear choices with
regard to how they are reacting or responding to what has been
identified as the first unusual thing.

PURPOSE

The improvisers in the scene are given a chance to practice
recognizing the first unusual thing.

This exercise also provides an opportunity for new improvisers
to slow down so that they can process the first unusual thing,
giving them a chance to consider why it is unusual.

The repetition of the first unusual thing also serves as a way to
guarantee that both improvisers are recognizing the same first
unusual thing. You can think of this as a way of underlining the
first unusual thing so that it stands out to your scene partner.



Finding the game
with a premise
Premise
$with an opening line
that contains the first unusual thing and an implied base reality. This
first unusual thing is discovered in an opening. An opening is the
beginning of a Long Form performed by the ensemble to generate
information after getting a suggestion from the audience. There are
many different types of openings. A few of them will be explained in
detail in the section on longforms.
The opening line or initiation of a Premise Scene is usually funny.
The contrast of the first unusual thing with the base reality laid out in
the initiation of a Premise Scene is what makes this initiation funny.
The details of the base reality cannot be neglected in a Premise scene.
The base reality @A;8B$A;3<B$31=$A;!6!C$is just as essential to a Premise
Scene as it is to an Organic Scene.
Premise is the term used to describe a fully formed comedic idea
found in an opening that strongly suggests a game. When starting a
Premise scene, an improviser will want to take one of the strongest
comedic ideas generated by the group in the opening and initiate a
scene with it. An advantage of performing an opening is that it allows
the entire group to work together to create comedic ideas. It is always
easier to start a scene with a comedic idea that everyone knows than
it is to start a scene with a comedic idea that is only from your own
head. If you present a premise line based on an opening that your
scene partner has participated in, it is going to be easier for them to
understand it and come to agreement.

Let’s look at some examples of Premise Scene initiations in which the
base reality and first unusual thing are both implied in a single line:
The base reality of this scene is that we are seeing a dog groomer at his
place of business dealing with a customer. The first unusual thing is
that the customer doesn’t want his dog’s hair cut but instead wants his
own hair cut.
The base reality of this scene is that we are seeing two neighbors in
an apartment doorway. Based on how Player 1 introduces himself, we
can assume that these characters don’t know each other very well. It’s
possible that they’ve never met before. The first unusual thing is that
Player 1 is asking to stay at his neighbor’s apartment in spite of the fact
that they don’t know each other very well.
As is the case with Organic scenes, the game will not be established
until the other improviser reacts or responds to this first unusual thing.
Since an unusual thing has been introduced in the very first line in
a Premise scene, you will immediately begin asking, “If this unusual
thing is true, then what else is true?” in the second line of the scene.
Let’s look at how the games we found in our two versions of the blind
date scene could have been found by starting with a premise that was
pulled from an opening.
Let’s imagine that a longform begins with a monologue as its
opening. A monologue opening is a short, true story or anecdote,
usually inspired by a suggestion from the audience.
A group of improvisers is given the suggestion of “blind date”, and
one of the improvisers steps forward and tells the following story:

CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

date where all that changed. Now, the guy! went on
this date with was perfectly nice, and actually pretty
good looking, but we just had nothing in common,
and honestly, | found him really boring. So ten minutes
into the date, | was ready for it to be over. But I’m
being “nice”, and sure enough, | start getting the vibe
that this guy is “into me”. And he’s a big talker, so
there’s not a lot of eating going on, and dinner is going
reallilly long. Finally, he finishes his meal, and the
waiter comes around and asks if we’d like the check

or dessert, and before | can say anything, he takes

the dessert option. So, reluctantly, | order dessert,

but | have the presence of mind to ask the waiter to
bring the checks with the dessert-this was a separate-
checks-date, FYI-this way, the second dessert’s over,

| can pay my bill, say my goodbyes, and this date can
be over. But for some reason, and | don’t know if he
had just said something especially boring, or if it was
the cumulative effect of too many dates with guys who
misinterpreted my “niceness” as interest, but when
the waiter dropped off the desserts, | was suddenly
seized with this pathological fear that continuing

on with this date was sending the wrong message,
and that | was in danger of ending up in a long-term,
committed relationship with a guy | had no interest

in, and | needed to end this date -now. But instead of
the boilerplate, end-a-bad-date move of saying | felt
sick, | decided to tell him that | suddenly realized | was
too full for dessert, so | was just going to pay my bill
and take off-which | did. But before | left-and | think

| thought this made things better-I told him he could
have my dessert, which I’m pretty sure didn’t make
things better, because despite him seeming “into me”,
| did not get the call for a second date.”

We're going to focus on two of the unusual things presented in this
monologue and demonstrate how they can be used to start two different

premise scenes with two different games.

1) The fact that guys tended to fall in love with this person over the
course of one date (in red)



A\ This person suddenly being seized with a pathological fear that
the date was in danger of turning into a long-term, committed
relationship, and therefore ending it abruptly (in blue)
The following is an example of a scene in which an improviser has
pulled the premise of “a pathological fear of commitment” (in blue)
from the monologue above and used it to find the game of a scene with
their scene partner.
Since both Player 1 and Player 2 have heard the same monologue, the
who, what and where of two people in a restaurant having dinner can
be assumed from the content of that monologue.
Player 2, assuming that Player 1 has been inspired by the part of the
monologue highlighted in blue, might respond this way…
This response has the effect of making Player 1 seem like someone
with a pathological fear of commitment. With this line, Player 2 has
established the game of this scene.
Now both players in this Premise scene are playing the game of “A blind
date in which one person has a pathological fear of commitment”

CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

The following is an example of a scene in which an improviser has
pulled the premise of “falling in love with someone over the course of
one date” (in red) from the same monologue above and used it to finda
completely different game of the scene with their scene partner.

EXAMPLE 2

[PLAYER 1 pulls out two chairs and places them across from each other.
Player 1 sits in one chair and gestures for Player 2 to sit in the other.]

PLAYER 1: “I’m so excited you ordered dessert. | wish this
blind date would go on forever too!”

Player 2, assuming that Player 1 has been inspired by the part of the
monologue highlighted in red, might respond this way...
PLAYER 2: “I ordered the dinner special. It came with dessert.”

This response has the effect of making Player 2 seem like someone who

is unwarrantedly accelerating a relationship. With this line, Player 2 has

established the game of this scene.

PLAYER 1: “I’m so excited you ordered dessert. | wish this
date would go on forever too!”

PLAYER 2: “I ordered the dinner special. It came with dessert.”

PLAYER 1: “So you knew you wanted to stretch this dinner
out from the moment you ordered? That’s
pretty much love at first sight! This will be a
story we tell our kids!”

PLAYER 2: “Whoa, what makes you think we’re going to
have kids?”

Now both players in this Premise scene are playing the game of “The
unwarranted acceleration of a relationship”



TELLING MONOLOGUES

y their very nature, any truthful reminiscences from your life are

going to be interesting without being fictional. Any story that
you remember when you are called on to deliver a monologue is
memorable because something happened that broke the expected
pattern of your everyday life. Monologues that are real stories and
memorable anecdotes are going to provide you with the type of
information that will be useful to improvisers looking for a starting
point for scenes. Remember, the audience doesn’t know you. You
don’t want to gloss over any part of the monologue you are telling
and assume that the audience will be able to fill in the blanks. Be
specific and detailed.

Trust that your true stories will be the best inspiration for scenes.
Don’t try to perform improvised stand up. You don’t want to riff or
go off on tangents inspired by the suggestion. Don’t launch into a
character. Don’t just offer opinions inspired by the suggestion. Most
importantly, don’t create a fictional story. If you try to be fictional,
you will most likely end up being derivative.

Don’t put pressure on yourself to be hilarious in a monologue
being used as an opening. A great monologue is nothing more than a
true reminiscence containing good specifics.

Note: there is nothing that you can’t talk about in a monologue.
However, in this book we are talking about comedic improvisation, and
some subject matter may be so sad or off-putting that you might end
up digging yourself a hole that you can’t climb out of. Ifa story is sad or
off-putting, you need to have an “angle” on it. Your angle is the ladder
that gets you out of the hole.

YES AND, AGREEMENT & LISTENING FOR INTENT IN
PREMISE SCENES
When initiating a Premise Scene, you want to clearly and concisely

communicate the premise you are pulling from the opening to your
scene partner. When responding in a Premise Scene, you will probably

be able to immediately start thinking in terms of “If this unusual thing is
true, then what else is true?” If your scene partner has done a good job of

initiating clearly, you will be able to forgo Yes And as it was employed in

Organic Scenes. If the first unusual thing is not clear in an initiation, you

might need to use Yes And until a specific first unusual thing is found.

Agreement plays the same role in Premise Scenes as it did in

Organic scenes. The improvisers will come to agreement about the
premise being used in an initiation. The improvisers must also come



CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

to agreement about how the specific pattern of this game will be
played out over the course of the scene. The characters in a Premise
Scene are going to behave in a way that will support and sustain this
game, even if that means the characters disagree with each other.
To reiterate a rule from earlier, improvisers are always agreeing;
characters are not necessarily.

Finally, you must listen for intent in Premise Scenes. Remember,
listening for intent doesn’t just mean hearing what your scene partner’s
character is saying, it also means hearing what your scene partner (the
improviser) wants. This is especially true for Premise Scenes. At the
start of a Premise Scene, you must be listening for what your scene
partner wants from you in their premise-based initiation. Listening to
your scene partner for subtext in an initiation will give you direction for
most of the choices you will make in the rest of the scene.

YOUR SCENE PARTNER’S PREMISE DOES NOT
LIMIT YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCENE

A; a new improviser, you may feel that when your scene partner
initiates a premise, they have limited your ability to be creative.
Remember, by presenting a premise, they have only offered a base
reality and first unusual thing. How you build on this first unusual
thing is up to you. Your scene partner initiating with a premise is

no more limiting than finding a first unusual thing together in an
organic scene.

PLAYING AT THE TOP OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE IN
PREMISE SCENES

Playing at the top of your intelligence is also important in Premise
Scenes. Failing to react to a premise-based initiation will cause your
scene to lack reality.

Let’s return to the dentist’s office from earlier. This time we'll have
Player 1 initiate with a premise:

EXAMPLE 1

[PLAYER 1 mimes pulling an x-ray off of a lighted display.]

PLAYER 1: “Your operation has been scheduled for Tuesday.
I’ll be anesthetizing you with brick.”



This initiation is clearly unusual. If Player 2 doesn’t react to this

initiation in some way, they will be making their character unusual as
well. An absurd premise does not stand out within an absurd context.
It is difficult to play the game of the scene in a focused way if there are

multiple absurd things happening in a scene.

A failure to play at the top of your intelligence when presented with
a premise-based initiation is a form of denial. More often than not, the

improviser initiating a Premise Scene from an opening is expecting
their scene partner to play into that Premise in a specific way. When

the improviser responding to the initiation fails to react, a premise is

wasted and a teammate is denied.

EXERCISE: GAME IN SKETCH

INSTRUCTIONS

View sketch comedy, either alone or with other improvisers.
(Some shows you could use for this exercise are Monty Python,
Saturday Night Live, The Kids in the Hall, Mr. Show, and Upright
Citizens Brigade.)

Identify the game by summing up what is funny about each
sketch. Describe the game in a few sentences or less. Then try
to describe it in one sentence. Then distill the game into five
words or less.

In distilling the game of each sketch, don’t use specifics or
create a plot synopsis.

Examples: The game of Monty Python’s “Cheese Shop” is
“specialty shop that does not sell what it claims to specialize
in.” The game of Monty Python’s “Dead Parrot” is “refusal to
acknowledge an irrefutable fact.”

Once you have identified the game, imagine it existing in
another situation with different specifics. (Example: A sketch
where a husband refuses to admit he has been cheating as his
wife catches him in bed with two women would have the same
basic game as “Dead Parrot.” A sketch about a Baskin Robbins
ice cream shop that has no ice cream would have the same
game as “Cheese Shop.”)



CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

Another level you could add to this exercise would be to try
and write out a new sketch using the game of a classic sketch.
Here is the start of a sketch using the game from the “Cheese

Shop” sketch:


“Welcome, my son. How long has it
been since your last confession?”

“Six months, Father.”
“Very well.”

“1 disobeyed my parents.”
“Nota sin.”

“Oh...1 thought | had failed to
honor thy father and mother...!
took the Lord’s name in vain...”

“Nope. Nota sin.”

“Really? I’m pretty sure that’s one
of the Ten Commandments.”

“I’m sorry, | don’t consider
everything a sin.”

“But I’m here for confession.”

“Yes, that’s right. We’re ina
confessional, I’m a priest;
confess away.”

“I thought impure thoughts about
a girl in my class.”

“Sorry, can’t forgive that one.”
“Why not?”

“No way for me to be sure you
did that.”

[The parishioner pulls money out of his pocket.]


“Look! This is money | stole from
a classmate!”



PRIEST: “Hmm, did you steal it or did you
borrow it?

PARISHIONER: “I stole it! | have no intention of
returning it!”

PRIEST: “Sorry, I’m still gonna give you a
pass on that one.”

PURPOSE

¢ Identifying the game of written sketches is a great way to train
your mind to recognize game outside of the classroom or
rehearsal studio.

Getting good at this will help you to identify games in your
improvised scenes that might be strong enough to develop

into written sketches. If you find that the specifics of the Long
Form scene you are trying to write up into a sketch just aren’t
translating to the page, you can try to find a new or better
situation or scenario to set your game in, just like the alternate
scenarios we were able to generate for the game of “Dead Parrot.”

EXERCISE: INITIATING FROM
MONOLOGUES

INSTRUCTIONS

¢ This exercise requires a group of at least three or more

¢ Asuggestion will be thrown out by one of the improvisers.
Someone else in the group will be inspired to step out and tell
a monologue inspired by this suggestion.

After the monologue, discuss all of the comedic ideas you heard
as a group. One way to recognize interesting or comedic ideas
is to listen to what made your group laugh. You should also

be listening for what was the essential “point” or “reason” for
the story. (This can often be described as the “one-line” version
of this monologue.) In addition to this central, core idea, there
will often be many great details that are interesting in and of
themselves, which will also be great fodder for scenes.



CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

* Next, go through the comedic ideas one by one and take
turns offering scene initiations that attempt to frame the
idea in the context of a scene. Use this process: Take the
comedic idea and imagine a scene that could come from
this idea. Then, try to imagine what the first line of this
scene would be. Offer this as your initiation.

¢ Asa group, discuss which initiations were most successful in
clearly communicating the comedic idea you want to explore
and an implied base reality.

¢ You can add another layer to this exercise by pairing up after
discussing the comedic ideas as a group. One improviser will
initiate using a comedic idea from the monologue identified by
the group. The second improviser will then attempt to respond
to this initiation in a way that takes the scene in the direction
intended by the initiator.

PURPOSE

¢ Discussing potential initiations from monologues as a group will
help you to get better at identifying the strongest ideas. You want
to use the ideas that are going to be funny to most of the people
in the audience, not just those ideas that you find to be funny.

¢ Premises are easiest to identify in monologues. This exercise will
let you put your focus on communicating premises clearly in a
single line.

HOW FULLY FORMED IS YOUR PREMISE?

Since finding the game organically and starting with a premise are both
equally valid methods, determining which method to use can be a point
of confusion for new improvisers.

INITIATING

Remember, when improvising off of a single suggestion without an
opening, you should focus your efforts on finding the game organically.
Initiating with a premise in this situation means forcing a premise that
you have created alone in your own mind. This is antithetical to the ideas
of teamwork and collaboration that are so critical to Long Form. Your
best bet when improvising off of nothing more than a single suggestion
is to enter and establish something about your relationship, activity, or
location (Who, What, and Where) and wait to see how your scene partner
chooses to Yes And your choice.



Openings will generally yield
three types of information:
premises, half-ideas, and chaff.
Premises are the most fully formed
comedic ideas generated in an
opening. A premise will strongly
suggest a game. A half-idea is
information that has some comedic
potential and which establishes
some part of the base reality of a
scene. Chaff is all the superfluous
information generated in an
opening that is not a half-idea or
a premise. It is information that,
when extracted from an opening,
is the equivalent of a one-word
suggestion. Starting with chaff does
no more than allow you to establish
some part of the base reality.
If you are performing off of an
opening, pulling a premise from the
opening should be your top priority
when initiating a scene. Since one of
the main purposes of an opening is
to generate funny ideas for scenes,
it is only practical to initiate with
premise. You’ve already done the
work of creating funny ideas with
your teammates; now you can use
them in your scenes.
When you consider all of the
premises generated in an opening,
some will be more fully formed
than others. Fully formed premises
are the premises that made the
most people in your group and in
the audience laugh. Using a fully
formed premise generated by the
group will get you into playing game
faster since starting with a fully
formed premise means starting with
a comedic idea that everyone in your
group already knows.
When initiating with a fully
formed premise from an opening,
it is important to make it clear that

you are making a choice both physically and verbally. Stepping out with
a purpose and confidence after an opening is the simplest way to let
your scene partner know that you have a fully formed premise in mind.
Don’t mince words with your initiation. Try to be as direct as possible in
getting to what you found to be funny in the premise you have selected
from your opening. Be clear in terms of how you want your scene
partner to react. Don’t start vaguely with the hope that you will get to
what is funny about your premise three to four lines in. Aim to make
initiations inspired by fully formed premises as tight as the first line of
a great sketch.
In your initial attempts to be clear and direct in your premise-based
initiations, you may find that they end up sounding forced or unnatural.
This is okay for someone who is new to Long Form. In the early stages
of your improv training, conveying an idea clearly is your first priority,
even if what you say sounds somewhat unrealistic and stilted. As time
goes on, you will want to make more of an effort to be as natural as
possible in your premise initiations. As you gain confidence in your
ability to isolate premises and lay them out clearly in initiations, think
about how someone in this situation would convey that information.
Let’s say that a monologist told a story about her difficulty with
remembering names, so severe that she once forgot her boyfriend’s
name while introducing him to her parents. Included in the story
were details about how she tried using instructional tapes to improve
her memory. Here are two premise-based initiations, inspired by the
monologue. They are both meant to start a scene about a class filled with
students whose memories are so poor that the objective of the class is to
simply help them learn their own names by the end of the semester:
This initiation is including the base reality and a first unusual thing that
clearly communicates the intended premise.
This initiation is not specific enough. An improviser saying this line
is hoping that they will get to the intended premise in a few lines as
opposed to one.

Initiating with the most fully formed premises generated by an
opening is not cheating. It is not pre-planning. It is making your task in
scene work infinitely easier. You could compare initiating with a fully
formed premise to climbing a mountain with a map and specific path in
mind. The opening is where you prepared for your mountain climbing
trip. Intentionally starting with a premise that isn’t as fully formed is
like scrapping all of your preparation and just saying, “Look, there’s a
mountain. Let’s climb it.”
While starting with the most fully formed premises should be your
goal, don’t worry that you must have a fully formed premise to start a
scene. Sometimes identifying the most fully formed premises in the
moment is difficult. Hopefully, there will be many interesting and
funny premises in your opening. Taking one that is less specific may be
more work, but you will still make it to the top of the mountain.
Furthermore, if your opening hasn’t generated a lot of premises,
or if you are simply having trouble identifying premises generated
within an opening, initiating with a half-idea and finding the game
organically is always a viable option available to you. While it might be
slightly less specific or detailed, a half-idea at the start of a scene may
appear the same as a fully formed premise to the untrained eyes of the
audience. Scenes starting with half-ideas shouldn’t be lacking purpose
or confidence in their initiation.
If you have no other choice, you can initiate a scene using some of
the chaff from the opening. This should be considered a last resort and
should only happen when you can’t identify any premises or half-ideas.
You are better off using chaff to initiate with purpose and confidence
instead of starting your scene awkwardly or tentatively as you search for
stronger information. Starting with chaff is going to be very similar to
performing a scene off of a single suggestion. If you find yourself in this
situation, follow the guidelines laid out for Organic Scenes. (Establish
something about your relationship, activity, or location and wait to see
how your scene partner chooses to Yes And your choice.)
When you are the improviser responding to an initiation, your
responsibility is to look for cues given to you by your scene partner
based on the type of information they are starting with.
When you are working off of an opening, you should work from
the assumption that your scene partner has stepped out first because
they have some degree of a premise in mind. Try to remember what
information they are taking from the opening. By considering their
initiation in relation to the opening, you should be able to identify
where on the continuum of information their initiation falls and react
accordingly. If your scene partner is using a fully formed premise,
you should have a more specific idea of how to respond in order to

get to the game suggested by this premise. If you feel that they may be
initiating with a half-idea or chaff, begin by Yes Anding their idea and
playing the scene at the top of your intelligence. (In other words, react
as you would in an Organic Scene.) If you are not entirely sure whether
the information being used to start the scene is chaff, a half-idea, or a
premise, play the scene at the top of your intelligence. This is always
the scene work principle that trumps all others.
The most important thing to keep in mind is that you do not want
to interrupt your scene partner, period. Don’t cut your scene partner
off. Let them get their initiation out. Give them the benefit of the
doubt for a line or two—whatever they need to clearly communicate
the information they have in mind. If you cut them off before they’ve
finished, you may end up denying a fully formed premise by adding
something new that is interesting or unusual. Even sound Yes Anding
should wait until after the initiation has been said. When responding to
an initiation inspired by an opening, your responsibility will be to start
asking, “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” You need
to know what version of this question your scene partner is asking in
order to answer it.

EXERCISE: IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION FROM
THE OPENING

INSTRUCTIONS

This exercise requires at least three improvisers.

One improviser will tell a monologue inspired by a one-
word suggestion.

Asecond improviser will then offer a single-line initiation
inspired by the monologue.

The third improviser (or any other improviser in the group)
will then guess what part of the monologue the initiation is
coming from.

The improviser initiating will confirm whether or not the
correct section of the monologue was identified.
Switch roles and repeat.

You can also try a version of this exercise where you guess
whether the initiation was using a premise, half-idea, or chaff.

PURPOSE

This exercise will help you get better at initiating. If your
teammates had trouble identifying the inspiration for your
initiation, maybe you weren’t “nailing it over the head” as hard
as you thought you were.

This is a great opportunity to practice initiating with each type
of information generated from an opening.

You will also get better at recognizing the difference between
premises, half-ideas, and chaff in initiations. Getting better

at making this distinction will make you better at responding
effectively and efficiently in scenes.



In premise improv, your goal is to make an initiation based on
something specific you thought was funny in the opening. To ensure that
you get to explore that funny idea you’ve identified in an opening, it is
essential that you get it across immediately and clearly in your initiation
line. If you don’t, your scene partner won’t know to explore that idea
with you, and very likely will go off in a different direction that makes
exploring your comic idea impossible.
So you must learn to distill what you find funny to its simplest, most
essential form so it is easy to clearly communicate.
A good premise initiation has a lot of information in it: It must
establish a base reality (who-what-where) and also the comedic premise.
But just because it has a lot of information doesn’t mean it should have a
lot of words. Quite the contrary, you want your initiations to contain only
the essential information needed to get your funny idea across.
Being able to get a base reality and a premise across in just a few
words is a muscle you need to develop. Newer improvisers tend to say
too much, or too little, not including the premise in their first line,
thinking they will get to it later in the scene.
Whether the initiation is too wordy or too vague, the problem is the
same: You risk that the other improviser will say something before you

get to your premise, taking the scene in a different direction, such that
your idea can no longer be explored.
Imagine someone shared a monologue about a terrible experience
they had on a plane when a person wouldn’t take the hint that they were
not interested in talking and wanted to be left alone.
This initiation does get a funny idea across, but it is so wordy that it
risks the other improviser jumping in and taking the scene in a different
direction before you deliver the full initiation. It also sounds unnatural.
This initiation fails to communicate what the initiator thinks is funny.
A few things could have happened here. One, the initiator has held
back the premise, thinking they’ll get to it in a future line. Two, they’ve
mis-used the monologue, focusing on chaff (the location of a plane)
instead of a funny idea. Three, they assumed the other improviser would
essentially read their mind and know the funny idea they had.
The more clear and concise your initiation, the more likely it is that
you will get to explore the funny idea you pulled from the opening.

CHAPTER FOUR « Finding Game

DISTILLING THE PREMISE IN THE
WRITERS’ ROOM

e learned the importance of clearly distilling a premise in the
writers’ room of the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch show.

When putting together episodes of our show we would put index
cards up on a cork board with titles of every scene being considered.
There would be thirty or more cards on the board at a time.

If a card had a vague title, we would have trouble remembering
what the sketch was. If it was more specific, everyone would instantly
remember the sketch because it brought to mind the scene’s premise.
It was the difference between “Construction Worker” and “Poetic
Construction Worker.” The former is general, while the latter reminds
you of the funny.

Exercise: Title the Game in
Five Words or Less

INSTRUCTIONS

Two improvisers take the stage and get a one-word suggestion.

They perform a scene, ending it once they have found a game.

Everyone not in the scene then attempts to title the game of
the scene.

Everyone then discusses the relative success of the various
titles. The criteria for a successful title: It’s as concise as
possible, while still getting across what it is that made the
game funny.

HERE’S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS EXERCISE MIGHT PLAY
OUT IN PRACTICE.

Let’s say the scene was about a doctor and a patient. The
patient is waiting for results of a blood test. The doctor
mentions how hungry he is, and asks the patient if he wants
to join him for lunch, after which they’ ll come back and find
out the results of the test. The patient says he’d rather just get



the results of the test. The doctor says, “It’s probably just
diabetes. Let’s say it’s diabetes. Come on: low-

sugar lunch on me.” And the man gets upset that the
doctor is just guessing.

HERE ARE POSSIBLE TITLES AND THE FEEDBACK THEY
MIGHT RECEIVE.

“The doctor’s more worried about how hungry he
is, and so he doesn’t want to wait for blood work
to see if this guy has diabetes—he just wants to go

to lunch.”
This is too long to be a good title. It doesn’t distill the premise.

“A guy wants to get a diagnosis, but the doctor won’t

give it to him because he wants to get a lunch.”
Again, too long.

“Hungry Man”
This leaves out the context of being at the doctor’s, i.e., an
important situation.

“Hungry People Do Bad Jobs”
Better than “Hungry Man” but still too general. Again, the fact
that he’s a doctor makes the stakes of his being bad higher and
adds to the comedy.

“Doctor mis-diagnoses because he’s so hungry.”
This leaves out that the doctor is being irresponsible and cavalier.
It implies he’s truly so hungry that he’s weak, i.e., not his fault.

“Bad Doctor”
This is too general and doesn’t get across the specific funny way
in which the doctor was “bad.”

“Angry Patient”
This focuses on the wrong part of the sketch.

“Doctor only talks about food.”
Good title! It gets across what is funny and is concise.

“Doctor Obsessed with Lunch”
Another good title!



Premise improv can be very difficult for beginners. There are a lot of
balls to juggle when simultaneously recognizing premises, retaining
them while investing in other people’s work on stage, and then
successfully delivering them in clear initiations. Realize that these are
skills that develop with practice. The more you do these things, the
easier they will get.
As you get more comfortable playing with people, you will learn
what to expect from them when they are initiating scenes. Some people
on your team will be extremely direct when getting to fully formed
premises. Some people will need to be given space in order to get to the
premise or half-idea they have in mind. As you get to know each other
in this way, you will be able to approach scenes without feeling rushed.
In turn, you will have a better chance at building scenes together that
resemble written works and real-life experiences. This is the value of
ensemble. There is inherent panic in the first few moments of almost
every scene when you are starting out. Just as it will take time for the
rules in this book to become second nature, realize that becoming a true
ensemble will take time as well.
Again, the UCB does not see any intrinsic advantage in either of
these methods of finding the game @H5=3641".5"#5894-8B. One isn’t better
than the other. Just be sure to use rehearsal time to get lots of practice
with both.

SECTION TWO * CHAPTER FIVE

Playing Game

Once you and your scene partner have
found the game, you will spend the rest

of the scene playing the game. In order to
play the game that you have found, both
improvisers will be asking themselves the
question, “If this unusual thing is true,
then what else is true?”

Three versions of this question are
used to play the game of a scene:

1. “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” This
question helps you to heighten the game. Heightening is the
act of making a game move ina scene that is in keeping with—
yet more absurd than—anything that has preceded it.

2. “If this unusual thing is true, then why is it true?” is asked
when exploring the game. Exploring is the act of making a
game move in a scene that provides the logic, philosophy, or
rationale behind absurd behavior.

3. “If this unusual thing is true, then what is my reaction?”
Asking this question will result in reacting at the top of your
intelligence to play the game by supporting the reality of the
scene. Any line that doesn’t heighten or explore the game
should be answering this question.

4. Once you have found the game of the scene, playing the
game means working with your scene partner to heighten
and explore the game to its fullest potential while reacting
at the top of your intelligence. Playing the game requires
improvisers to make use of all of the key scene work principles
involved in the base reality of the scene: agreement, listening,
commitment, and playing at the top of your intelligence.

Topics covered:
e Heightening a scene
¢ Using “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true”

* Continue to play to the top of your intelligence, even as the game
gets absurd

e Explore the game, to make the absurd believable
« Use good listening to get more ways to heighten and explore



Heightening
as a machine that pumps out
“funny.” Game is the engine of the scene. It is your job to make choices
in the scene. Your choices provide the fuel for the engine. If Then just
helps narrow down the available choices. Heightening narrows down the
available choices even further.
Heightening is the act of making a game move in a scene that is
more absurd than anything that has preceded it. Each heightened game
move will deviate even further from the expected pattern of reality. It
is important to heighten within the parameters of your game. Random
absurdity will not help heighten your game. When you are answering,
“If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” in order to find
game moves that are increasingly absurd, you are heightening your
specific game. Heightening the pattern of behavior is an important part
of playing the game because it keeps your game funny and interesting to
the audience.
Heightening is the responsibility of both improvisers in a scene.
The burden of finding new specifics that fit in with the game shouldn’t
have to fall on the shoulder of just one improviser. Both improvisers are
responsible for moving the scene forward and making new discoveries
that will heighten the game. While it is easier to explore as a voice of
reason, it is still possible for you to play this role and provide heightened
game moves. The “voice of reason” in a scene can still actively heighten

the game by mentioning things that have happened in the past, noticing
things in the environment, etc.
Heightening may seem like a difficult task. Asking, “If this unusual
thing is true, then what else is true?” is how you find heightened game
moves that are in keeping with the game of the scene. Heightening
with this question helps you to add new game moves to the pattern that
started with the first unusual thing. Game moves come in the form
of lines of dialogue and actions. Heightening saves you from having
to constantly create new randomly funny things to say to your scene
partner out of nowhere.
You don’t have to come up with randomly funny lines. You need to
come up with answers to a specific question.
Improvisers in a scene should let the pattern sustained by If Then
do the hard work of the scene for them. Once you start heightening a
game together, it actually becomes easier to continue doing so. Imagine
having to push a car from Point A to Point B. If you had to push the car,
wait for it to stop, and then start pushing it from a point of rest again (the
equivalent of having to come up with a new stand-alone joke to garner
laughs), then that task would be very difficult. It would be much easier to
get the car rolling and then just keep it rolling (the equivalent of playing
the game to garner laughs). Instead of starting over, you will be able to
build off of the momentum of all of the other heightened moves you
have already made.
Here’s another analogy to consider: Do you think it would be easier to
1) write a brand new sitcom—including an entirely different premise and
characters—every week, or 2) write a new ,&*-"%, of an existing sitcom
for which the premise and characters are already known? The first
option would be far more difficult than the second. Heightening a game
is just using what has already been established in your scene, just as
sitcom writers use what has already been established about their show.
Kenneth’s relentlessly positive attitude in every episode of 30 Rock is an
example of game. The writers of this show essentially ask themselves,
“If Kenneth is relentlessly positive, then what would he say or do in this
given situation?”
Heightening by asking, “If this unusual thing is true, then what else
is true?” is an efficient method for creating comedy. This method will
make performing scenes easier. At the beginning, you will find yourself
literally asking this question in your head. Over time, it will become
second nature, and you will find yourself automatically answering, “If
this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” in your scene work.
You will know that you are truly in the moment when you find yourself
automatically asking If Then questions without thinking so hard about it
for each and every line.

CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

EXAMPLES OF HEIGHTENING IN SCENE WORK

Let’s return once again to our example of the dentist that wants to
anesthetize his patients by hitting them with a brick. This time,
we will allow the scene to continue in order to get some examples
of heightening.

The red lines in parentheses and italics will illustrate the
improviser’s thought process and show you how they used “If this
unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” to get to another
heightened game move. Heightened game moves are colored blue
and labeled HGM# (explanations to follow):

EXAMPLE 1

Two improvisers are given the suggestion “x-ray.”

[PLAYER 1 mimes pulling an x-ray off of a lighted display.]

PLAYER 1: “I’m afraid the tooth is going to need to be pulled.”
PLAYER 2: “I’ll get anesthetic for a procedure like this, right?”
PLAYER 1: “Yes, I’ll be anesthetizing you with a brick...”
PLAYER 2: “A brick? | don’t understand.”

PLAYER 1: “I’m going to put you under by hitting you on the
head with a brick.”

PLAYER 2: “You’re going to hit me with a brick? Why aren’t you
using gas?”

PLAYER 1: It’s actually much safer than gas. Almost no one
has ever died from a concussion, but a significant
percentage of people will have a bad reaction to the
gas—asphyxiation due to vomiting, memory loss—”

PLAYER 2: “Hitting me with a brick could also result in
memory loss!”

1 THINKS: (If /’m a dentist who thinks that using a violent
method like hitting someone with a brick as an
anesthetic is a sound medical procedure, then what
else would I consider to be an appropriate way
to anesthetize my patients? | can offer to hit my
patient with a different type of hard object.)



PLAYER 1:

PLAYER 2:

PLAYER 1:

2 THINKS:

PLAYER 2:

“If you’re uncomfortable with getting hit with a
brick, I’d be more than happy to fill up a surgical
glove with smaller rocks and hit you with that.”

“1 don’t have a problem with what I’m getting hit
with, it’s that I’m getting hit.”

“| would understand your concern if some
stranger off the street was going to hit you
with a brick, but I’m a trained professional.”

(If my dentist seems serious about using a brick
to anesthetize me, then what type of brick is he
going to use? | can ask if it is a special “medical”

“So wait. Is it a medical grade brick? Like one that is
sized and proportionate to my weight?” (HGM2)

(Player 1 mimes pulling a brick out of a cabinet.)

PLAYER 1:

“Oh no, it’s a standard construction-style brick.
But I spent over eight years in medical school
learning how to strike you with it medically.”

(Player 1 rears back, brick in hand.)

PLAYER 2:

1 THINKS:

PLAYER 1:

“Wait! Wait. | really don’t want to get hitin the
face with a brick.”

(If I’m a dentist who employs violent methods in
my treatment of patients, and | am dealing with
a patient resistant to my methods, then what
sort of similarly violent, alternate method can |
offer to use?! can offer to put my patient under
using a “sleeper hold.”)

“Okay. | think | understand what your objection
is. There’s been some interesting research out of
Harvard involving manual asphyxiation, or the
“sleeper hold,” in layman’s terms. Let me show
you...” (HGM3)



This game can continue as long as both improvisers are able to answer
more If Then questions.
The first thing to notice is that it takes a few lines before the first
heightened game move happens. The improvisers used the lines
prior to the first heightening to establish a base reality, find and
frame a first unusual thing, and clearly establish a game before any
heightening occurred. No matter how long it takes you to do this,
all of the aforementioned elements of a scene should come before
any heightening.
Also notice that there are technically only three heightened
game moves in the first 17 lines of this scenes. This rest of the scene
is still funny even though heightening doesn’t happen in every
line. Heightening isn’t the only way to be funny. If you try to force
heightening in every line, you are likely to sacrifice the “flow” or
believability of the scene. When you force heightening to happen, you
and your scene partner will end up with something that feels more like a
list than a scene.
Finally, notice that both Player 1 and Player 2 make heightened
game moves, even though this scene follows the “Character, Voice of
Reason” Format.
The heightening in this scene is good. They don’t repeat the first
unusual thing over and over. Instead, they find new specifics that fit
their game by asking, “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is
true?” Additionally, each new specific or answer to this question is
slightly more absurd than what has come before.

become more absurd in two ways. First, he asks about
“medical grade bricks.” There is no such thing as a “medical
grade brick.” We have moved further from the expected
pattern of reality. Beyond the new specific, the fact that he is
now honestly considering getting hit with a brick is also more
absurd. The scene has heightened with his behavior.

HGM3: Using acommon wrestling move to anesthetize a patient
seems more absurd than striking someone with a hard object
while still maintaining the pattern of “violent, unorthodox
medical procedures.” The fact that it is presented as a reasonable
alternative by this dentist contributes to the absurdity.

The absurdity of each subsequent game move in any scene is always
going to be somewhat subjective. Follow your gut in making moves that
you feel truly heighten your game. If the next game move you make
doesn’t seem heightened to some members of the audience (or even
some members of your ensemble!), it will still serve your scene as long
as it follows the pattern of your game by answering, “If this unusual
thing is true, then what else is true?”

Now let’s return to one of our “blind date” example scenes for more
examples of heightening. Let’s look at the version of the scene that
played the “unwarranted acceleration Of a relationship” game.

The red lines in parentheses and italics will illustrate the improviser’s
thought process, and show you how they used “If this unusual thing
is true, then what else is true?” to get to another heightened game
move. Heightened game moves are colored blue and labeled HGM#
(explanations to follow).

We will also point out the first unusual thing, and the first game move
of the scene in parentheses directly after the lines in which they occur.
You'll note that this scene does not “frame” the first unusual thing, but
moves directly on to providing a first game move in response to the first
unusual thing.

“Okay, he can just be a witness then. (Player
2 stands and addresses the restaurant) “Is
there a captain in the restaurant with a ship
nearby?!” (HGM 6)

A lot of heightening happened in this scene! The improvisers found the
first unusual thing by the third line on the scene, made the first game
move in the fourth line, and began heightening with the sixth line,
continuing to play the game for the rest of the scene.



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

IMPORTANT: Note that both improvisers made heightened game moves,
even though it was a “Character, Voice of Reason” scene. While Player
1, the Voice of Reason in this scene, made only one HGM, there is
no limit to the amount of HGMs a Voice of Reason character can
contribute to a scene. A Voice of Reason character is not confined to
only providing grounded reality and top of their intelligence reactions
to the other character’s game moves. That being said, understand
that top-of-intelligence reactions and grounding moves are no less
valuable contributions to the comedy of a scene than are HGMs. Asa
Voice of Reason character you should take advantage of both, choosing
whichever option best serves the comedy of the scene in the moment.
Let’s take a closer look at the heightening to see if it meets the criteria
of answering, “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” and
having each additional game move be more absurd than the last.

HEIGHTENED GAME MOVE EXPLANATIONS

HGM1: Player 2 makes the first heightened game move by asking
the question: “If I’ve decided that someone is “the one”, but I’ve
only just met them, then what does that mean?” They come up
with the answer: “This is a case of love at first sight.” This game
move is heightened from the first game move of the scene, in
that it moves on from the belief that they have met “the one” (a
fairly common belief many people have in regard to the person
they end up marrying), to the belief that they have experienced
the far rarer “love at first sight”. Therefore, this move meets the
criteria for a heightened game move.

HGM2: Player 2 makes the next heightened game move by
asking the question: “If I’m sure that I’ve met “the one”, but
they don’t want to go on any more dates with me, then what
does that mean?” The answer they come up with is: “They must
want to get married!” This game move is heightened from the
previous game move, as it moves from the feeling of “love at
first sight” to, arguably the greatest commitment one can make
to another out of love, marriage. Therefore, this move meets the
criteria for a heightened game move.

HGM3: Player 2 makes the next heightened game move by
asking the question: “If I’m sure that the love of my life wants
to get married, but then they change their mind, and say there
isn’t going to be a wedding, then what does that mean?” The



answer they come up with is: “They want to elope!” We know
eloping is heightened from marriage because Player 2 tells us it
is with the second sentence in their line, “It’s more romantic!”.
Therefore, this move also meets the criteria for a heightened
game move.

HGM4: This is the first heightened game move made by Player
1. Up until this line, Player 1 had only been adding top of their
intelligence grounding to the scene, objecting logically to Player
2’s unwarranted acceleration of the relationship. Wanting to
add a game move to the scene, Player 1 asks the question:

“If Player 2 is determined to accelerate this relationship,

then what physical evidence of this fact might | notice in the
environment?” The answer they come up with is: “Player 2

is wearing a napkin ring like it’s an engagement ring.” This
game move is heightened from what has preceded it by way
of being the first physical evidence of the game in the scene,
and its adding a “visual” (in improvisational terms) element
to the game. Therefore, once again, this meets the criteria of a
heightened game move.

Almost all of the lines delivered by Player 2 after the first game move
of the scene are heightened. Player 2 heightens from the initial game
move in which they share that they have decided that Player 1 is “the
one”, to declaring that they’re attraction to Player 1 was “love at first
sight”, to believing that they and Player 1 will be married, to thinking
they will, even more romantically, elope, to deciding that they will
be married immediately, right there in the restaurant. Player 1 also
found an opportunity to make a game move by choosing to notice
something unusual in the environment that was in keeping with the
game of the scene.

You'll notice that not every game move in the scene was heightened
from the move preceding it, and that is perfectly acceptable. This is a
successful scene because after the game is established, there is no chaff.
All the lines or actions after the initial game move either provide a new
game move (more often than not, a heightened one), or support the
game with top-of-intelligence reactions to game moves, making those
game moves stronger as a result.



Listening is not only important for finding the game. Improvisers must
listen after the game has been found as well. Each line in a scene is
important. If you stop listening and recede into your own mind for your
next line, you could potentially miss extremely important moments in
your scene and make your job more difficult.
After the game of the scene has been found, your mind should
begin dissecting each line you hear to see how it fits into the pattern
of behavior that has already been established. You should be listening
carefully to every line to determine how your scene partner is setting
you both up to play the game again. Have they made a game move
to heighten the game? Have they set you up to heighten? If you are
listening, then you will be able to react accordingly.
The importance of listening has already been emphasized, and it will
be emphasized again. It is the most important thing for you to be doing
at every moment in a Long Form show.

Just as reacting at the top of your intelligence when presented with a
first unusual thing in a scene allows you to recognize the starting point
of your game, playing at the top of your intelligence will help you to
sustain your game. The game should remain the only unusual thing
in the scene so that it stands out as you play it. A commitment to the
reality of the scene will help the absurdity of each new game move
stand out in contrast.
Remember that reacting at the top of your intelligence is part of
playing the game. In order to maintain the integrity of the scene, it
is important that the characters continue to react accordingly as the
actions or specifics of the scene get heightened. If there is a voice
of reason in the scene, he can’t react to the heightened game moves
that will come two minutes into the scene in the same way that he
reacted to initial game moves. Think about how your reactions would
change in real life after dealing with someone who is acting unusual or
unreasonable for two minutes. How you interact with this person would
change over time in real life, and this change must also occur in scenes.
For example, you may start with polite discomfort, but after two minutes
you may exhibit full-on anger. If this doesn’t happen, the scene will feel
like it is moving laterally, and its humor will be lost.
Continuing to play at the top of your intelligence is also necessary for
sustaining the game of the scene when playing the character with absurd
or unusual behavior. Remaining committed to and consistent with your
character’s point of view and behavior will help you to elicit laughs from
the situation rather than relying on clever one-liners.
Also note that it is important for you stay physically committed to
the reality that you created at the start for the entire scene. It is easy to
get so focused on the game that you drop your environment. Staying
committed to all of the choices you make, including those about your
environment, will help you sustain a reality against which you can play
your game.

CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

Two improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly
establish a reality containing a Who, What, and Where.

The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other and get
more specific until they discover the first unusual thing.

Once the two improvisers performing the scene find the
game, one of the players on the back-line should tag-out
either improviser by tapping them on the shoulder. When an
improviser is tagged out, they are taken out of the scene and
replaced by the improviser that did the tagging. The person
who has been tagged out will join the back-line.

Usually, an improviser tagging into a scene will play a new
character. For this exercise, the improviser that tags in will take
over the character that has already been established. In other
words, the scene should continue exactly where it left off, with
the same two characters and the same game.

Once the first tag-out happens, the rest of the improvisers

on the back-line may begin to tag into the scene. Either
character can be tagged out and taken over as long as the new
improviser enters to play the same game by asking, “If this
unusual thing is true, then what else is true?”

Afterwards, discuss as a group which moves were in keeping
with the game and which moves didn’t work.

PURPOSE

¢ This exercise will help expand your mind in terms of heightening.
With multiple people performing the same scene, there should
be a lot of creativity and variation with regard to heightening.
Hopefully, this will help everyone in your group see the myriad
options and possibilities for heightening any game.

It will also give your group a chance to practice heightening
without having to worry about any of the other responsibilities
one must normally consider when performing a scene.
Improvisers can watch the scene from the back-line and think of
nothing other than heightening.

This exercise also offers you a chance to examine the subtle
differences between those moves that are on game and those
that are not.



Exploring
can also be thought
of as “funny lines” and “funny behaviors.” Clearly, our goal in comedic
improvisation is to be funny. However, funny things happening for no
reason will rarely result in a satisfying scene. The heart of a great Long
Form scene is not just what you are doing, but also why you are doing it.
Our term for figuring out why things are happening is “exploring.”
The exploration of your game gives you a whole new way to be funny.
Exploring is the act of making a game move in a scene that provides the
logic, philosophy, or rationale behind absurd behavior. In addition to
asking, “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” in order
to find heightened game moves, you should also be asking yourself, “If
this unusual thing is true, then G;7 is it true?” in order to explore. Why
is the character doing this, or why is this happening? Each exploration
game move is dealing with the details and specifics discovered in the last
heightened game move. When exploration game moves are made, new
absurd elements may be introduced that will also need to be questioned.
Think of playing the game of a scene as a stair step. If heightening is
going up, then exploring is going over. Exploring gets you to your next
heightening and vice versa.

The diagrams below are visual representations of games being played
with Heightening moves alone, and with Heightening and Exploration.
In these diagrams, the length of the line equals funny. In Graph 1,
the game is being played through heightening alone. In Graph 2, each
vertical line segment represents heightening, and each horizontal line
segment represents exploration. If you were to measure the length of the
line on each of these graphs, the line on the first graph would be much
shorter than the length of the line on Graph 2. The game, as it is played
in Graph 2, is going to get a lot more laughs. Strong exploration moves
that ground the absurd can be thought of as doubling your comedy.
Once you understand the importance of exploring, you could include
it in the anatomy of an improv scene, like this:

Exploring can happen in two main forms. The first form is when a
voice of reason attempts to justify the behavior or actions of the absurd
character in a scene. When the voice of reason offers a justification,
they are setting up his scene partner for further heightening in the
next move. The second form of exploration is when the character or
characters with absurd behavior internally ask, “Why do I have this
absurd or unusual behavior?” The answer that you come up with is the
philosophy or motivation of your character. Once you know this, you can
import your character’s game into any situation and know how to act.
Your character’s absurdity is no longer a result of being crazy or dumb.
There is a reason behind it. You have made “the silly” smart.
When making exploration game moves to answer “why,” don’t make
new absurd choices. Instead, make choices that are plausible and logical
in relation to the absurd element you are justifying.
Making a good exploration move is like telling a good lie in real life.
The smarter and more logical the lie, the more likely you are able to
string someone along. Therefore, the smarter and more logical you are
with your exploration moves, the further your game can go.
Let’s imagine a scene in which there is an elephant in your
apartment. This needs to be justified. Saying that the zoo you work
at has closed down because of low funding justifies the unusual in a
smart, plausible way while still being funny. Saying that the elephant
was given to you by a magical genie is an exploration move that adds an
unnecessary, new absurd element to the scene.
When exploring, you don’t have to try to be funny; you should try to
be logical. This logical answer, juxtaposed with the absurd behavior,
is what will make your scene funnier. When you can form sound and
logical explanations for absurd behavior, you are playing your scene at
the top of your intelligence. When you are performing, be the character,
don’t play the character. In other words, you are not playing a “comic
character.” You are playing a real person. Real people have reasons
for their behavior. When you provide real reasons for your character’s
absurd behavior, delivered in a believable way, you will get laughs. Think
of yourself as a lawyer defending your premise.
You don’t have to know the logic behind the game before you find
it. Make choices and then create the logic to justify those choices in
the moment. It is important to remember that you can be free to make
choices in the moment and then discover your point of view later
through exploration.
All other lines that play the game will be reactions at the top of your
intelligence. When absurd behavior is questioned or challenged, the
voice of reason has set up the other improviser to either heighten or
offer the logic, philosophy or rationale driving their character.
You do not want to play your game by heightening only. If you
heighten without exploring and reacting at the top of your intelligence,
you will run past of a lot of comedy in your scene. There is comedy in

the philosophy and logic driving a character’s actions. Defending or
justifying an absurd behavior with logic is, by its very nature, funny.
Sometimes knowing the reason behind an absurd action can be even
funnier than the absurd action itself. Additionally, if you are too focused
on heightening a pattern and don’t think about playing the rest of the
scene, you may reach a level of absurdity so quickly that it will become
too hard to continue thinking of increasingly absurd moves. Finally,
exploring and reacting at the top of your intelligence helps the audience
invest in your scene. If your scene only heightens, it will likely become
too silly and disposable. Determining why a character has absurd
behavior helps your scene mirror the reality of life. Absurd or unusual
behavior is questioned, challenged or justified in real life. No matter
how stupid or ridiculous their behavior is, people in real life always have
reasons for their actions. When you explore or react, you are providing
this realistic behavior in an absurd reality. This makes your scene and
your characters more realistic, and in turn gives your audience more to
relate to.
Just as a scene shouldn’t be all heightening, you shouldn’t focus
solely on the exploration. Once you have finished reacting or offering an
exploration, you should look for a way to provide the next heightened
game move. Adding another heightened specific will in turn inspire the
next round of exploration, and so on.
Scenes that incorporate heightening and exploration are going to be
more satisfying. A good scene might heighten and still be forgotten. A
great scene will go back and forth between heightening and exploration.
This will result in smart comedy as opposed to silly comedy.
Let’s look at an example of using exploration as a way to ground an
especially silly premise.
[Player 1 initiates physically. He mimes sitting at a bar. Player 2 mirrors
this choice.]

This is a funny !"#$%&$’(%)&$)*(+,-+%’’.$/0/)/%’1 premise that will probably
get a laugh on its own. However, to sustain the laughs in this scene
beyond the “crazy” choice, you will have to support it with reasonable
logic. Player 1 might explore his unusual behavior in the following way:
Player 1 can now heighten by talking about the absurd aspects of his
relationship with this dolphin. He can always return to the core logic
provided by this exploration game move to support the increasingly
ridiculous specifics that he and his scene partner will come up with$!(232$
Now let’s return once again to our example of the dentist that wants
to anesthetize his patient by hitting them with a brick. This time, we will
analyze all of the examples of exploring and reacting at the top of your
intelligence in this scene.

Notice that the first “exploration game move” in this scene happens
before any heightened game moves. This is because the first unusual
thing should be reacted to and/or justified before the behavior can be
made into a pattern. By focusing on exploration before heightening,
the improvisers performing have made their comedy smart and not
just silly.

All of the exploration game moves and reactions in this scene are
also funny. Remember that heightening isn’t the only way to be funny.
By offering strong reactions and justifications, these improvisers have
maximized the comedy in the scene.

It is also worth noting that both characters are asking questions in
this scene. New students of improv are often told to avoid questions.
Remember, this rule only applies to the beginning of an Organic scene
when you are working to establish a reality and discover the first unusual
thing. Asking questions in the game section of the scene is acceptable,
and often necessary to play the game of the scene. Questions like the
ones in this scene, which are helping the improvisers play their scene in
a way that mirrors real life, actually serve the scene and are necessary
for sound exploration game moves.

EXPLORATION GAME MOVE EXPLANATIONS

Let’s first look more specifically at each exploration game move in
this scene:

EGM1: Player 1 offers a reason for his character’s absurd
behavior. In his mind, there is risk and danger involved in

most medical practices. This is a thought process that medical
professionals employ in real life. By using realistic human
behavior in the service of the absurd, Player 1 gets a laugh while
making this scene smarter. This is the start of a philosophy that
he can return to later in the scene.

EGM2: In this line, Player 1 doesn’t have to search for a new
philosophy. The same philosophy that was driving his character
in his earlier exploration game move is driving his character
here. His understanding of risks involved with any available
method of anesthesia is due to his standing as a trained medical
professional. He is using his expertise to act in the best interests
of his patient.

EGM3: Again, Player 1 simply returns to the philosophy
already established to account for new absurd specifics. He
has remained consistent and committed to his philosophy.



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

This, in turn, makes his behavior a pattern. Each time he hits
the pattern, he gets another laugh without having to do much
more “work.”

EGM4: Player 1 offers a justification of the strangulation
heightened game move that completely fits in his established
philosophy. “Medical strangulation” is a method that he, a
trained medical professional, is qualified to employ.

TOP OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE REACTION EXPLANATIONS

Now let’s look more specifically at each reaction line that also plays
the game of the scene.

TOIR1: The first reaction is an example of strong top-of-
intelligence play. The voice of reason in this scene is simply
questioning the unusual and setting his scene partner up to
offer a philosophy. It is unglamorous, but it is a necessary part of
playing this game.

TOIR2: The voice of reason reacts by challenging the philosophy
of the absurd character. He points out that getting hit with

a brick shares a consequence with gas-based anesthetics
(memory loss).

TOIR3: The voice of reason once again reacts to the top of his
intelligence by pointing out the similarity between getting hit
with a brick and getting hit with a glove filled with rocks. He
challenges the absurd as a person might in our reality. He can’t
believe this is happening, which is what one normally thinks
when the unusual happens in the real world.

TOIR4: Player 2 reacts at the top of his intelligence, setting up
Player 1 to heighten.

TOIRS: Player 2 reacts at the top of his intelligence, setting up
Player 1 to offer another exploration game move justifying the
new absurd specific of using strangulation.

Now, we are going to look at the version of the “blind date” scene

that played the game of “a blind date in which one person has a

pathological fear of commitment” with all heightening, exploration,
and reactions labeled.



The red lines in parentheses and$,&%’,+) illustrate the improviser’s
thought process and show you how they used the question “If this
unusual thing is true, then what else is true?” to get to another
heightened game move. Heightened game moves are colored blue and
labeled HGM# (explanations to follow).
The purple lines in parentheses and ,&%’,+) will illustrate the
improviser’s thought process showing you how they used the
question “If this unusual thing is true, then why is it true?” to
explore. Exploring game moves are colored green and labeled EGM#
(explanations to follow).
The orange lines in parentheses and italics will illustrate the
thought process leading to reactions that are at the top of one’s
intelligence. These top-of-intelligence reaction lines are in black and
labeled TOIR# (explanations to follow).
We will also point out the first unusual thing, the framing of the first
unusual thing, and the first game move of the scene in parentheses
after the lines in which they occur.

CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

Dessert was included with the dinner specials we
ordered, so there was no “moving on” to it, and
therefore our dessert can’t be interpreted as having
the significance Player 1 is assigning to it.)

PLAYER 2: “We ordered the dinner special. It came with
dessert!” (HGM1)

1 THINKS: (If! interpret everything my date does as a sign
that things are moving too fast, then how can!
interpret my date getting angry and yelling at
me? | assume that we are fighting because we are
spending too much time together.)

PLAYER 1: “See, we’re spending too much time together.
We’re already fighting. Let’s just call this off and
get out of here.” (HGM2)

PLAYER 1 stands to leave.

2 THINKS: (If Player 1 tries to leave the restaurant when we
have only just gotten our dessert, and therefore
haven't finished our meal or paid the check, then
what would my reaction be? | would point out
that we haven’t paid our check yet.)

PLAYER 2: “We haven’t gotten the check yet.” (TOIR1)

1 THINKS: (If! interpret everything my date does as a sign
that things are moving too fast, then how can!
interpret Player 2’s pointing out that we haven’t
paid the check yet? | am going to assume that
they are using the check as a reason to stay
together, like a married couple who should really
get a divorce might use the fact that they have
children together as a reason to stay together.)

PLAYER 1: “Staying together because we have a check to

pay isn’t a good enough reason to stay together.”

2 THINKS: (If my date is erroneously interpreting my
not wanting to leave because we haven't yet



PLAYER 2:

1 THINKS:

PLAYER 1:

2 THINKS:

PLAYER 2:

1 THINKS:

paid our check as an attempt to remain ina
relationship with them, then how can | disabuse
them of this misconception? | will point out
that remaining to pay the bill is simply what is
necessary at the end of a meal purchased ina
restaurant in order to not walk out on the check,
and has no greater significance.)

“That’s not ‘staying together’, that’s staying so we
don’t walk out on our check.” (TOIR2)

(If my pathological fear of commitment is
making me worried that things are moving too
fast on this date, then how else can | use the
check we’re discussing to further demonstrate
my pathology? Ill indicate that | had agreed to
pay the check earlier, but that |!am no longer
comfortable doing so, as I’m worried it might
be interpreted by Player 2 as my having feelings
for them.)

“About the check-I know | said I’d pick it up, but
now I’m worried that’s sends the wrong message.
I think you should pick it up.” (HGM4)

(If my date, who is acting very strangely, on
what has turned into a very uncomfortable date,
wants me to pay the check which they agreed to
pay, then what would | do? | would be annoyed,
but just pay the check in order to have this
terrible date be over.)

“Really? You know what, fine, whatever, I’ll pay
the check.” (TOIR3)

(If | was comfortable with asking my date to pick
up the check that | had agreed to pay, then why
was | comfortable doing that? | was comfortable
asking them to pay the check that I had agreed to
pay because | was compassionately trying not to
give them false hope that | have feelings for them.)



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

PLAYER 1: “I’m just afraid that if! pay the check, it’ll give
you false hope that I’m going to spend the
rest of life with you. I’m trying to do the right
thing.” (EGM1)

2 THINKS: (If my date is still trying to renege on paying the
check, on the grounds that they want to do the
“right thing’; then how can! get them to pay
the check? | will use their purported desire to
do the right thing against them, and tell them
that the “right thing” to do is to pay the check.)

PLAYER 2: “The ‘right thing’ is paying the check you said
you’d pay.” (TOIR4)

1 THINKS: (If my character is convinced that this relationship
is moving way too fast, then how can | use Player
2’s wanting me to pay the check as evidence
that things have gotten way too serious? 1 can
interpret their behavior as analogous to the kind
of vindictive behavior one might see during nasty
divorce proceedings, indicating that | see this date
akin to our being so far into a relationship we are
already at its bitter end.

PLAYER 1: “I see what’s going on here -you want to hurt me
financially to get even with me for hurting you
emotionally.” (HGM5)

2 THINKS: (If! notice that my date is treating my very
logical desire for them to pick up the check
as they agreed to as being analogous to the
spiteful actions of someone going through nasty
divorce proceedings, then how will! react? |
will call out the fact that they are talking about
our disagreement as if we were negotiating the
terms of a divorce, and hope that the insanity of
their doing so is self-evident.

PLAYER 2: “You’re talking about this like I’m trying to take
you to the cleaners in a messy divorce.” (TOIR5)



1 THINKS: (If, despite it angering my date, | am continuing
to argue that they should pick up the check | had
agreed to pay, then why am! continuing to do
this? I’m continuing to argue that my date should
pick up the check because I’m a good person, and |
don’t want to hurt them by leading them on.)

PLAYER 1: “I’m trying to help you avoid a messy divorce
by making it perfectly clear that | am in no
way, shape, or form looking for anything
resembling a long term relationship with you.
I’m trying not to hurt you.” (EGM2)

2 THINKS: (If my date thinks that he’s protecting me from
interpreting this below average blind date
as the beginning of a meaningful, long-term
relationship, then how willl respond? | will
make it clear to them that | am in no way in
danger of seeing our interaction as anything
but a subpar first date.)

PLAYER 2: “Oh my God! You’re not going to hurt me! It’s just
a first date!” (TOIR6)

1 THINKS: (If 1 have a pathological fear that this blind date is
in danger of turning into a long term relationship,
then how might I perceive that danger in what
Player 2 has just said? | will latch onto Player 2’s
having called this a “first” date, and interpret that
as them assuming that there will be others.)

PLAYER 1: “See?! | knew it! You called it a first date, like
we’re going to be going out every night now.
We need to pump the brakes. | mean, look at
this-there’s a candle on the table-we’re already
having candlelit dinners.” (HGM6)

2 THINKS: (If there is a candle on our table when neither of
us wants a romantic relationship, then what is
the explanation for this? We are at a restaurant
that has candles on all the tables, which is
quite common.)

2 THINKS:

“Every table in the restaurant has a candle on it!
Everybody’s having candlelit dinners!” (TOIR7)

(If Player 1 continues to get angry with me, and
raise their voice, then how can | interpret that
behavior as being indicative that the relationship
has moved forward too quickly? I can see it
as the kind of behavior you often observe in
dysfunctional long term relationships.)

“1 know you feel like you’re in love with me,
but I think you’re just addicted to the drama.”

(If my date is accusing me of being addicted to
drama that he’s unnecessarily causing, then
how would | react? | would point out that they
are the cause of all the drama.)

“You’re the one causing the drama!” (TOIR8)

(If Player 2 is getting angry over my concern
that this relationship is moving too fast, when
all I’m trying to do is protect them from being
hurt, then how can | assuage their anger? |
will take responsibility, and acknowledge my
part in the problem.

“You’re right, this is all my fault. | should have
picked up on the sign that things were moving
too fast way back when we ordered those dinner
specials with the dessert, and just ended the
date right there.” (HGM8)

(If my date thinks that the completely
innocuous act of ordering diner specials, which
happened to include dessert, was the first sign
that things were moving too fast, then how
would I respond? | would make it clear that
ordering dinner, whether or not it includes
dessert, when you are ona dinner date is in no
way indicative of things moving too fast.)



PLAYER 2: “You think ordering dinner - on our dinner date -
was a sign things were moving too fast?” (TOIR9)

1 THINKS: (If Player 2 seems to disagree that ordering a
dinner special that includes a dessert proves
that our relationship was moving way too fast
since the beginning of the date, then how can
! convince them that our relationship has been
moving way too fast since the beginning of
our date?! will reassert that ordering dinner
specials that include dessert is problematic,
and | will bring up an even earlier clue that the
relationship was moving too fast from the very
beginning of the date.

PLAYER 1: “With dessert? Yes. Also, you were already
waiting here when | got to the restaurant. |
should have picked up on that and realized
that you were way too eager right out of the
gate.” (HGM9)

2 THINKS: (If! was already waiting at the restaurant when
Player 1 arrived, but | know it wasn’t because
! was “too eager’; since I’m the “normal” one
in this situation, then why was | waiting for
them to arrive? | was at the restaurant waiting
for Player 1 to arrive because they were
10 minutes late for the date, making what
Player 1 said yet another example of their
misinterpreting the reality of the situation
due to viewing it through the lens of their
pathological fear of commitment.)

PLAYER 2: “I just got here on time, like you’re supposed to
when you make plans with someone! You were
ten minutes late!” (HGM10)

1 THINKS: (Ifl’ve decided that this date becoming problematic
is downstream of Player 1’s attitude coming into
the date, then how can | interpret what they’ve just
said as more evidence of this? | will interpret their
being angry over my not doing something they feel



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

| was “supposed to” do (be on time) as evidence
that they had “expectations” coming into the date
which has caused problems.

PLAYER 1: “Wow, you came into this with all kinds of
expectations, didn’t you? I’ve changed my
mind-this is all your fault.” (HGM10)

We will now further analyze the EGMs and TOIRs in the preceding
scene, but before we do, let’s once again point out that both characters
in this scene were able to contribute HGMs to the scene, and while, once
again, the Voice of Reason character (Player 2) happened to contribute
more TOIRS than HGMs (in this case, two), remember that there is no
limit to the amount of HGMs a Voice of Reason character can contribute
to a scene.

EXPLORATION GAME MOVE EXPLANATIONS

Let’s take a closer look at the exploration lines of the scene, and how
they work to play the game of the scene by addressing the “why?”of the
unusual behavior.

EGM1: This first exploration game move made by Player 1 lets
us know their character’s point of view and the motivation
behind their behavior. Specifically, we learn that their fear of
the relationship moving too fast stems from their desire to

do the right thing, and not lead Player 2’s character on. This
exploration explains and grounds why Player 1 subjectively
feels it is okay to share their feeling that the date is lasting
“way longer” than they thought it would, when, objectively,
doing so is incredibly rude. This exploration, while grounding
Player 1’s rude behavior by sharing their internal logic, also
serves to make their rude behavior funnier. Letting us know
that Player 1’s rudeness is the result of misguided kindness and
thoughtfulness makes it funnier than if we were left to assume
it stemmed from malice, selfishness, or indifference.

EGM2: This exploration is consistent with, and strengthens,
the point of view and motivation Player 1 established for
their behavior with their first exploration game move. Player
1, seeing that expressing their true feelings about this date

to Player 2 is angering them, feels the need to again explain
that they are just trying to be thoughtful, and prevent Player 2



from being hurt. Then, in the name of this goal, they go on to
express, in the harshest way yet, their unequivocal disinterest
in Player 2, feeling that this is the noble and caring thing to do.
Again, Player 1 provides the inner logic behind their choice to
share feelings that most people would keep to themselves. It is
out of the goodness of their heart that Player 1 is determined to
be blunt and guileless, even if it may seem rude.

TOP OF INTELLIGENCE REACTION EXPLANATIONS

Now let’s look at the reaction lines, and how they make the scene
funnier by providing a grounded reality against which the absurdity
of the game moves stands out.

TOIR1: For this first reaction line, Player 2 did some quick
thinking. After Player 1 suggested they end the date
immediately and leave the restaurant, they reasoned that if
their dessert had just arrived, then they hadn’t finished dinner,
and therefore must not have paid their check yet. They then
shared this fact with Player 1. This top of their intelligence
response reinforced the fact that Player 1’s assertion that the
date was going on too long was untrue, and a product of Player
1’s pathological fear of commitment.

TOIR2: In this reaction line Player 2 simply refutes the reality
that Player 1 suggests (You are choosing to stay in a relationship
with me because we have a check to pay.), and offers up what

is actually true (I am choosing to stay in this restaurant because
we have a check to pay). This is a very simple top of intelligence
line, the template for which could be described as: “No, ‘x’ is
not true, ‘y’ is true.”

TOIR3: In this reaction line Player 2 thought about the actual
discomfort they would feel if they found themselves ona
date with someone who was acting so oddly, and decided
that they would probably just pay the check to get out of the
situation. This was a great example of the efficacy of simply
doing what you would actually do in real life in response to
an unusual circumstance in a scene. Some improvisers might
have worried that if they agreed to do what Player 1 wanted,
then the “conflict” would be over, and that this would put

an end to the comedy of the scene, and perhaps the scene



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

itself. But by agreeing to pay they check, while getting across
their exasperation and annoyance at having to do so to
accommodate Player 1’s irrational fears, Player 2 gave Player 1
a great opportunity to respond with an exploring game move.
Since Player 1’s character felt comfortable with backing out

of paying the check and asking Player 2’s character to pay it
instead, they must have thought it wouldn’t be an issue. So
when they could tell that Player 2’s character was annoyed by
their request, and that it clearly was an issue, they decided

to have their character respond with a exploring game

move, clearing up the misunderstanding by explaining the
misguidedly benevolent thought process behind their backing
out of paying the check.

TOIR4: In this reaction line Player 2 demonstrates some good
listening, picking up on Player 1 claiming they want to do the
“right thing”, and suggests to Player 1 that paying the check
which they had agreed to pay is in fact the “right thing” for
Player 1 to do. They challenge Player 1’s odd logic with common
everyday logic. Player 2 expresses the opinion most average
people would have, which highlights the fact that Player 1’s
opinion is unusual, and enhances the comedy of the scene.

TOIRS: In this reaction line Player 2 simply reflects back to
Player 1 the insanity of what they have just asserted in their
previous line. This is very similar to what one does when
framing a first unusual thing, and is a valid top of intelligence
response to any absurd line. A reflective response like this
one is acharacter's attempt to get another character to
acknowledge what they’ve just said, in the hopes that they
will recognize that it is wrong or inappropriate. Reaction lines
like this draw the audience’s attention to the absurdity of the
previous line by restating its absurdity.

TOIRE: In this reaction line Player 2 is simply responding in
the way an average, logical person would likely respond to
the sort of illogical fears and worries Player 1 is expressing.
You can never go wrong with this type of TOIR.

TOIR7: In this reaction line Player 2 provides context fora
fact (a candle on their table) which Player 1 has attempted to



use in their previous line to substantiate their belief that the
relationship is moving too fast. The context which Player 2
provides (that all the tables in the restaurant have a candle on
them) makes it clear that Player 1 has misinterpreted the facts
of the situation due to their pathological fear of commitment,
and it is this that gets the laugh. This is a case of Player 1

and Player 2, in effect, working together to make a game
move. The game move isn’t fully realized, and there really
isn’t a laugh, until Player 2 provides context for Player 1’s
previous line with their reaction to it. Like an alley-oop pass
in basketball, Player 1 sets Player 2 up to “score” the laugh by
providing context for Player 1’s line.

TOIR8: In this reaction line, once again, Player 2 simply refutes
what Player 1 has just said and responds with what is true.
Player 1 accuses them of being addicted to drama, and Player 2
responds that Player 1 is causing all the drama.

TOIR9: In this reaction line Player 2 both reflects back to Player
1 what they have said, and reminds Player 1 and the audience of
the context in which Player 1’s previous line was said. Providing
this reflection of Player 1’s previous line (you think ordering
dinner was a sign things were moving too fast) and the context
in which it was said (a dinner date) amplifies the comedy of the
game move that Player 1 was making with their line.

LISTENING HELPS YOU EXPLORE

If you continue to utilize listening throughout your scene, you will make
playing your game much easier. Listen to your scene partner's reaction
to each of your lines. Each reaction will offer new information that
informs your own choices and helps you to continue to heighten and
explore your game.

Listening is essential for exploration. Each new line may contain new
specifics that will require justification. If you fail to listen and choose to
play your game by spouting off a never-ending rant, you will contribute
so much information to the scene that your scene partner will not know
which choices to justify or support.

If you don’t listen, you will be essentially doing the scene by yourself,
and you will inevitably “run dry.” The lack of new information generated
from working together will ultimately cripple your scene.

A failure to utilize listening when playing game is referred to as
steamrolling. Doing this will make you look bad to the audience and



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

will make other members of your ensemble dislike performing with you.
Although you may be getting laughs, acting selfishly and autonomously
will make the scene a terrible experience for your scene partner.

WORK TOGETHER TO PLAY THE GAME

Lore Form Improvisation is not a solitary pursuit. While the stand
up comedian will get laughs from their own cleverness, the Long
Form improviser will get laughs from the efforts of a group. It is much
easier to listen to your scene partner for ideas than it is to come up
with ideas on your own, out of the blue. In Long Form, you don’t have
the pressure of being hilarious by yourself. You can relieve some of
the burden of being funny by working with someone else.

It is also important to note that listening is much more than a tool
to make improvising easier. It is absolutely necessary for the success
of any scene. No matter how strong you may believe your own idea
is, it will be impossible to make your idea a reality on your own. This
is because you will never be able to plan out what your scene partner
may Say or do.

The creation of a Long Form improv scene should come from
somewhere to occur between both improvisers. This approach
should actually make building scenes easier. It is like having two
people work together to lift something heavy instead of one person
doing it alone.

The only way you can truly embarrass yourself in Long Form is
by NOT listening on stage. If you start plotting out the scene in your
own head, you will be denying those ideas that your scene partner
is contributing. If you disrespect your scene partner in this way, the
scene will suffer, and you will ultimately be making yourself look bad.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAYING AT THE TOP OF YOUR
INTELLIGENCE AS YOU EXPLORE

When you react at the top of your intelligence, you force yourself to use
logic to explore your game. Once you have found a game, you want to
play it as intelligently as possible. This means making exploration moves
that support your game in the most logical way.

Playing at the top of your intelligence also means sustaining the
reality of the scene (or everything that is not the game) after the game
has been found. We want everything else in the scene that is not a
game move to be as close to reality as we know it. Sustaining this
reality supports the pattern of absurd behavior. Offering reactions that



are at the top of your intelligence will sustain the reality. A failure to
react at the top of your intelligence will make the reality of the scene
unnecessarily absurd or clever. This will only distract from the humor
already being generated by your game.

Commitment helps you to play at the top of your intelligence for the
duration of the scene, whether you are reacting or exploring. Staying
committed to your character’s logical, realistic, top-of- intelligence point
of view will help guarantee that you and your scene partner will be able
to fully explore each new heightened game move.

QUESTIONS IN THE SERVICE OF EXPLORATION

When you are playing the game of the scene, playing at the top of
your intelligence often manifests itself through your character asking
questions. Asking a question often happens at the very beginning
of your game in order to frame the first unusual thing in a scene. By
asking a question in reference to the absurd, you will ground your
scene in reality and allow your scene partner a chance to ground his
or her bizarre actions with reasonable logic.

Once you have found your game, questions give you an
opportunity to continue to explore it. We know that it is important
to explore the logic behind what is absurd; otherwise, your scene
will heighten too quickly, and you will miss nearly half of your
opportunities to get laughs. Ultimately, questions will be necessary
when you are playing at the top of your intelligence. Your character
will ask questions at points during the scene when you would ask
questions in real life.



CHAPTER FIVE « Playing Game

EXERCISE: UNDERSTUDIES -
REPRISE

INSTRUCTIONS
Six to eight improvisers take the stage.

Someone else in the group offers a one-word suggestion to inspire
any two improvisers on the stage. The rest of the improvisers will
stand on the back-line.

Two improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish a
reality containing a Who, What, and Where.

The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other and get more
specific until they discover the first unusual thing.

Once the two improvisers performing the scene find the game, one

of the players on the back-line should tag-out either improviser by
tapping them on the shoulder. When an improviser is tagged out, they
are taken out of the scene and replaced by the improviser that did the
tagging. The person who has been tagged out will join the back-line.

Usually an improviser tagging into a scene will play a new character.
For this exercise, the improviser that tags in will take over the
character that has already been established. In other words, the scene
should continue exactly where it left off, with the same two characters
and the same game.

Once the first tag-out happens, the rest of the improvisers on the
back-line may begin to tag into the scene. However, in this version of
Understudies, you can’t tag someone else out until the previous game
move has been explored. You may tag in to explore the last heightening,
but you can’t tag in to heighten again until exploration happens. An
improviser from outside of the group should be watching and stop the
scene if someone tags in to heighten before exploration occurs.

Either character can be tagged out and replaced as long as the new
improviser enters to play the same game.

Afterwards, discuss as a group which moves were on game and which
moves didn’t work.

PURPOSE

This version of Understudies will force you to focus on exploration by
making you do it after every new heightening. This doesn’t always
have to happen so rigidly in scenes, but it is a great way to strengthen
your exploration muscles.



¢ Multiple people working the same scene should offer a lot of
creativity and variation in terms of exploration. Your goal as a group
should be to make moves that complement and fall in line with earlier
exploring moves.

It will also give your group a chance to practice exploring without
having to worry about any of the other responsibilities one must
normally consider when performing a scene. Improvisers can watch

the scene from the back-line and focus on exploring.

EXERCISE: PREMISE LAWYER

INSTRUCTIONS

A group of at least three improvisers take the stage and form a circle.

One improviser steps into the circle to play the “premise lawyer.”

Improvisers standing on the circle will raise their hands when they
have a premise in mind.

The premise lawyer will call on an improviser to hear their premise.

Note: The premise should be absurd so that it challenges the Premise
Lawyer to defend it. For example, “I want my employees to double
their productivity” isn’t a premise, because wanting employees

to increase productivity is not an unusual thing. A similar premise
that would work might be, “I want my employees to work a 22-hour
workday in order to double their productivity.”

The premise lawyer will then offer an exploration move that supplies a
“why” for the absurd or unusual behavior or idea central to the premise.

EXAMPLES

Premise: “I don’t think people should drink water.” Possible
Exploration Move: “I’m really into conservation, so | think people are
just wasting water every time they drink it.”

Premise: “Reading should not be taught in schools.” Possible
Exploration Move: “If we teach the children to read, they will
eventually overthrow adults and assume control of the world.”


Premise: “All dogs should be named ‘Fuzzy.” Possible Exploration
Move: “Being nice to other people’s dogs would be so much easier if
you knew ahead of time what their names were.”



To play game, you should always be heightening, exploring, or reacting.
The key to making any game work is making the absurd believable.
If you think about our day-to-day lives, we do ridiculous and
completely idiotic things all of the time. When you make a poor choice
or say something ridiculous in real life, your intention is not to make
yourself look like a fool. It often seems like we are making the right
choice in the moment. There is logic to and a reason for our actions.
This is how you want to approach playing characters in scenes. Your
goal should be to make the absurd believable at all times, whether you
are heightening, exploring, or reacting. Don’t take on wacky or silly
affectations. When you commit to the scene, you give your characters
logic and reasons for their absurdity.
Hitting someone over the head with a brick is the absurd element of the
scene. For the sake of the scene, you should protest that. If you blindly
agree to this procedure, you are ignoring the reality of a real pre-surgery
patient and doctor interaction. Your character is now suddenly more
absurd than the first unusual thing.
There are other options that exist within the extremes described
in the above paragraph. If you respond to the brick line by saying,
“Hmmm…that seems a little weird,” you are resorting to clever
commentary. As an improviser, you are acknowledging the funny idea
in the scene instead of reacting to it as a character. If you respond to the
brick line by exclaiming, “You’re crazy! I’m out of here!” you have gone

from “zero to sixty.” This is a response you have to earn. People don’t
immediately come to conclusions about something unusual in real life.

When you take the time to react, question, or offer moves that fit your
character’s logic, you are making the absurd believable. Be as real as you
can. Stay true to the moment of the experience every step of the way
through a Long Form scene.

SECTION TWO * CHAPTER SIX

Using
Character to
Play Game

In this chapter, we go over ways to
develop strong, committed characters
for your improv.

Some people are under the impression that characters
in comedy must be broad, with silly voices or strange
physicality. However, we don’t want our characters to
simply be silly for no reason. Instead, we want to let
reality inspire our characters and their unusual points of
view, then commit to them, and play them to serve the
game of the scene.

Often, a character will talk and move exactly like you do,
except the character will have an unusual perspective
that becomes the game. Or you’ll be inspired by an
archetype from a genre like a detective in a film noir.
Oryou’ll base your character off of someone you know.
But in all cases, the characters play to the top of their
intelligence, and you play them with commitment,
looking to serve the game of the scene.

Playing characters close to yourself, different from
yourself, or that have a character game
Maintaining top-of-your-intelligence play

real life as inspiration

Character
Types
a version of yourself at the top of your
intelligence, there are essentially three possibilities for portraying
characters in a Long Form scene.
The first possibility is to play an everyman character. An everyman
walks, talks, and sounds like you do, and he has a rational, grounded
point of view that adheres to the expected pattern of reality. The voice
of reason is almost always an everyman character. If the character you
are playing could just as easily walk and talk the way that you do, it isn’t
necessary for you to adopt any sort of affectation.
For example, you might be called on to play a doctor in a scene.
Even though you aren’t actually a doctor, you can choose to have the
doctor you are playing walk and talk exactly as you do. Choosing to play
yourself will increase the chances of starting the scene in a grounded
reality, making it easier for you to recognize the first unusual thing in
your scene.
Once a game has presented itself, the doctor you are playing may
become more of a character because of his ideology or point of view.
However, there is no reason to change the way you speak or move. The
viewpoint will separate the character from you, the improviser.
The second possibility is to play a support character. A support
character sounds or moves differently from you in order to serve
the reality of the scene. These differences are necessary to play the
character in a realistic way. These differences are not there to get laughs.
When you are playing a support character, it is important that you do
so truthfully, not to a heightened degree in order to get laughs. Your
character choice is aiding the reality of the scene.
For example, if you are a twenty-something male improviser and your
scene partner labels you as an old woman in their initiation, it will be
distracting to the reality of the scene if you have your old woman sound
and move like you do. Remember, you don’t have a costume or make-up

to make this character believable. Changing the way you walk or talk,
without being too broad, is going to better serve your reality than being
an old woman who walks and talks like a young man. You might want
to adopt a feminine pitch to your voice, move slowly, and walk with a
stooped posture to portray this old woman.
If you are an improviser playing an NFL linebacker, you will also
need to change the way you sound and move. Imagine the gruff talk,
almost military tone of an archetypal football player talking after a
game. If you don’t, one of two things will happen. Either you will be a
distraction from the game of the scene by drawing attention to yourself
as an improviser, or worse, you will unintentionally take over the game
of the scene, because the strange behavior of this NFL football player
(i.e. not acting like a typical athlete) will automatically stand out as the
most unusual thing. Make a character choice as the NFL football player,
play it realistically or at the top of your intelligence, and find a game
organically within this situation.
The third possibility is when the character you are portraying essentially
is the game of the scene. These characters are referred to as game
characters. Just as the game of the scene has a funny, consistent
pattern, a game character that is serving as the game of the scene will
have a funny, consistent pattern of behavior. When a game character
is in a scene, the game of the scene is played through heightening and
exploring the game character’s behavior. “Bigger” or “more extreme”
characteristics are justified in these circumstances because they don’t
distract from the game; they are an integral part of the game.
If you are playing a lifeguard who is acting like grizzled soldier from
a war movie, the absurdity of the lifeguard’s behavior will become the
game of the scene. The game will be played through asking, “If this
lifeguard is acting like a grizzled soldier, then what other things might he
say or do?” Your behavior as this character will answer this question and
become the game of your scene.
In this example, playing this scene like a “normal” lifeguard won’t
support your game. As an improviser, you must be conscious of both
content and performance choices. Maybe if you refer to the other
summers you have worked as a lifeguard as your previous “tours of duty,”
you will do so in a grave voice, squinting your eyes and staring off into
the distance. Using the term “tours of duty” is a content choice. Saying it
in a grave voice and squinting your eyes would be performance choices.
Your response to kids running around the perimeter of the pool might
be a panicked barking of orders to dig trenches to avoid being too close
to the edge of the pool, delivered with the urgency you would expect to
hear from someone trying to evacuate a base camp under fire. Again,
ordering trenches to be dug is a content choice; doing so with urgency is
a performance choice.

Acting and commitment to character choices are just as important
in Long Form improvisation as they are in written materials such as
plays, television shows, movies, etc. The fact that you are creating your
characters in the moment without rehearsals, costumes, or a script
doesn’t make you exempt from acting well when portraying them.
Whether you have trained as an actor or not, a Long Form scene needs
you to do the best acting that you possibly can. Act to the best of your
ability. Don’t use bad acting as a source of comedy in your scene. Play
your character as though you are trying to convince the audience that
the character is real. Every time you succeed in doing this, you are
playing your character at the top of your intelligence.
The importance of “acting well” in Long Form improv cannot be
stressed enough. However, this is not to say that you need to spend two
years studying at an acting conservatory in order to perform Long Form
improvisation. You will act well if you play at the top of your intelligence,
which will have the effect of grounding your characters in reality. Most
of the time, simply speaking, moving, and reacting as you do in every
day life will be enough to serve the scene.
A key element to making your character choices work in Long Form
is your commitment to the choices you make. Once you have created a
specific perspective for your character, it is important that you remain
true to it. If you have adopted a different manner of speaking or moving
in order to play your character, it is important that you remain consistent
and committed to these choices. Commitment to these choices will take
the focus away from the fact that “the improviser is playing a character,”
and put it on what the character is doing and saying. You should never
sell your character out for a laugh (e.g. commenting on how poor your
accent is or calling out that you are extremely tall for a child).
The characters you play on stage should only differ from yourself as
necessitated by the game. Character eccentricities without justification
or relevance to the game are distracting. This is not to say that there is no
room for character work in the Upright Citizens Brigade style of improv,
but characters in UCB improv must always support or embody a game.
Character choices should be inspired by the suggestion or the
choices made during the creation of the base reality of your scene.
You should not make choices to simply show off your favorite stock
characters. In other words, don’t rely on your bag of tricks. While you
may have a great “southern lawyer” or “hyperactive six-year-old” in your
back pocket, arbitrarily forcing these characters into a scene will ring
false. Honor the process and your scene partner by making choices

in the moment that serve your scene. However, if it serves the scene,
pulling your southern lawyer or hyperactive six year-old out of your bag
of tricks is valid and appropriate.
When you create a game character for yourself in a Long Form scene,
you use the same process you use to find a game in an Organic Scene.
Broad choices or pre-planning are unnecessary when it comes to
creating memorable characters. Let’s say you start a scene with this
simple initiation:
By choosing a specific attitude or point of view that is unusual and
breaks the expected pattern of reality, you have already told us a lot
about your character with only a few simple words. You have provided
a starting point for developing a character. This statement is not
really about birthday cake; it’s about the type of person who has this
response to being thrown a birthday party. From this line, you can
develop a character by asking, “If this unusual thing is true, then what
else is true?”
By asking this question, you might decide to adopt a specific voice
affectation or movement to continue filling out this character. Maybe
this person speaks in low tones at a slow tempo. Maybe he shuffles his
feet when he walks. You will also want to ask why your character is
behaving this way to ensure that you explore as well as heighten this
character’s game.
The following are lines of dialogue that would be considered
heightening game moves for this game character:
The following are lines of dialogue that would be considered exploring
game moves for this game character:
All of these lines would be supporting the initial choice you made
with your first line. When you are playing a game character, you won’t
feel desperate about making each line funny. If you make choices

that are consistent with your character, you will get laughs. Making
choices that support your character will allow you to play the game of
your scene.
Usually, the most inspired and fully realized characters come from
a real place in the improviser’s life as opposed to being cartoonish
archetypes. A family member, coach or good friend can serve as
inspiration for those characters you have to play that are especially
different from you. You can even draw on characters you have seen
in television, films, the news, or documentaries as a reference to play
those characters that are outside of your natural type.
The more you actually know about the type of person you are
playing, the better you will be able to make your character seem
real. When drawing on real people and fictional characters that you
are familiar with in order to portray a character, you should always
choose the option that you are closest to. Primary sources are the real
people that you actually know and have interacted with. Whenever
you have the opportunity to tap into a primary source when portraying
a character, you should. Secondary sources are real people that you
have seen in, such as documentaries or news programs. Tertiary
sources are pre-existing fictional characters. For example, if you were
playing a mafia boss, you might draw inspiration from Don Corleone
in!"#$!%&’()*#$+ or Tony Soprano in "#$!,&-+).&/. These will be the
least effective since you will be doing an impression of an impression.
No matter what source you draw your inspiration from, don’t
allow yourself to slip into caricature. Real specifics will make any
character choice seem real and your job easier because you won’t have
to struggle to fabricate these specifics. Portraying characters three-
dimensionally and with integrity will help you avoid cheap or easy
laughs. Don’t make hacky, obvious or cheesy choices in your portrayal.
Committing to the reality will increase your odds of being able to find
and play a game. Find the truth in your characters.
Even the most three-dimensional characters can be problematic
if you force them into a scene where they do not belong. You may get
laughs, but you will do so at the expense of the greater good of the scene.

EXERCISE: CREATING CHARACTERS
FROM BELIEFS

INSTRUCTIONS
Your entire group should take the stage.

Walk around and take turns speaking. When someone speaks, everyone
else should stop walking and listen. When they have finished speaking,
everyone can move again.

Start by stating personal beliefs or opinions. Stay away from jokes and be
as honest as possible. These statements should be simple, even mundane
personal opinions. Examples: “You should never read the ending of a
book first.” “You should take a nap every day.” “You should turn the lights
off when you leave a room.” “Always yield to pedestrians in a cross walk.”

After walking and sharing statements for a few minutes, form a back-line.

Take turns initiating scenes as characters that embody one of the
personal beliefs that was shared. The personal belief shared will serve as
the inspiration or starting point for a character. Each improviser must use
a belief other than the one he or she shared.

As the scene progresses, ask yourself, “If this unusual thing is true, then
what else is true?” or, “If this unusual thing is true, then why is true?”
Even though you are starting with something simple, you can find ways
to heighten and explore this initial belief (e.g. the person who believes
that you should turn the lights off when you leave a room might grow
into someone who is militant about conservation).

You don’t literally have to repeat the belief as the start of the scene. For
example, if you’re working off of someone saying, “You should never
read the ending of a book first,” you might initiate a scene by saying, “I
like to see the mystery of life unfold in the moment.” You have started
your scene with the intent behind this belief but not the exact wording.
You should be asking yourself, “If this type of person never reads the
ending of a book first, then what else would they do? What type of
person is that to me?” Maybe this person has always packed up their
things in a truck, driven to a new city, and then looked for an apartment.
Maybe this person is really bad at chess, since he or she avoids thinking
several moves ahead.

PURPOSE

This exercise will help you practice making game character choices.

This exercise is also an opportunity to practice committing to or
remaining consistent with a game character.



CHAPTER SIX - Using Character to Play Game

EXERCISE: USING PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTICS TO
CREATE CHARACTERS

INSTRUCTIONS

Your entire group should get on stage except for one person.

Start walking around the room and acknowledge each other
without speaking.

You should try to notice, as you walk, which part of your body you
naturally lead with. People tend to lead with their heads, chest, pelvis,
or feet as they walk.

Once you have all figured out what you lead with, you should
exaggerate leading with that body part and play with how it makes you
feel—what kinds of characters does it suggest to you?

The person sitting out will then call out different body parts. The rest
of the group will then simultaneously switch to the announced body
part (head, chest, pelvis, feet, etc.) as a group.

Each time a new body part is called out, allow yourself to discover

a character based on how your movements make you feel. Then
mingle with the other characters on stage, having 2-3 line exchanges
with them.

Now only two improvisers take the stage to use this same process to
make character choices for scenes.

Both improvisers should create characters by changing how they
move physically. The improvisers can either choose a body part to
lead with on their own, or another member of the group can give them
suggestions. The two improvisers should walk around the stage in this
new way until they "find" characters.

The improvisers should once again be thinking, "What kind of people
walk this way? What do they enjoy? What do they hate? What kinds of
things might they say? What is their status (high vs. low)? What is their
worldview (optimist vs. pessimist)?”

Once both improvisers seem ready, have someone else from your
group give them a one-word suggestion to inspire a short scene.

The two improvisers should be able to incorporate whatever they have
decided about these characters into the scene, no matter what the
circumstances of the scene are.



¢ Ifyourscene partner is the first to speak, and verbally identifies you
as a character different than what you have decided upon, you should
abandon your character choice and go with theirs while maintaining
your physical behavior. Example: Your movement caused you to feel
like you were an old person who has difficulty walking. Before you
can make this clear with dialogue, your scene partner interprets your
movement as the walk of a toddler and labels you as such. While
maintaining the same walk, you should play this scene as a toddler.

PURPOSE

This exercise shows you how you can bolster your character choices
through physicality. If you’re playing a high-powered CEO who is
confident and in charge, you could make the quick choice to lead with
the body part that makes you feel this way.

EXERCISE: USING STATUS
TO BUILD A CHARACTER

INSTRUCTIONS

Your entire group should get on stage.

Start walking around the room and acknowledge each other
without speaking.

As you pass each other, you should try to act as if you are a bit higher
in status than everyone else you interact with. Each interaction should
also serve to increase your status.

Try to find different ways to express your status (e.g. not making eye
contact, walking with a swagger, walking with good posture, etc.).

After a few minutes, someone will announce that everyone in the
group born in the months of January through June should reverse and
become lower in status with each interaction, so that about half the
group will be going for high status and half low.

After a few more minutes, everyone should go for low status, trying to
be the lowest status of every interaction.

When you have finished acting low in status, have everyone take a seat
and discuss the exercise. Talk about how people with higher status
look and behave compared to someone with low status.

Now, only two improvisers get up on stage.



CHAPTER SIX - Using Character to Play Game

* Someone else in the group should assign one improviser to be high
status and the other low status.

* Someone else in the group should give these two improvisers a one-
word suggestion to inspire a scene.

¢ Tell them that in addition to the Who, What, and Where, they should
make their status towards each other clear in their first three lines.
These are quick scenes. Someone else watching the scene should stop
the scene after about a minute. It is not necessary for the improvisers
to find the game in these quick scenes.

* Next, have the same two improvisers rewind the scene, repeating the
same lines again but with the status reversed.

¢ Replaying the exact same scene with different status helps to highlight
that your role in the scene is not the same as your status (e.g. a boss
can be high-status one time and low-status the second but still be trying
to talk to his employee about doing overtime).

¢ Notice the distinction between the assumed status in life and
status in the scene. You can be a very high-status butler and a low-
status president. When we talk about status, we are referring to
the behavior of the characters, not their assumed status in life. You
should also notice that high status does not necessary equal “mean”
or “evil” or “loud.” You can be a quiet, serene, magnanimous high-
status character.

EXERCISE: USING PEOPLE YOU
KNOW TO CREATE CHARACTERS

INSTRUCTIONS
* Two improvisers should take the stage.

¢ Each improviser should take on the mannerisms of someone they
know well. Specifically, they should think about how this person
moves, behaves, etc. Focus on using behavior, not biographical
history, as the inspiration for each character.

¢ Theimprovisers should then say a few lines of dialogue in character to
the rest of the group in order to display their character choices.

¢ Next, the improvisers will get a one-word suggestion from someone
else in the group to inspire a scene using these characters.



Biographical information from the real person’s life should not
complicate the scene. For example, if the character in the scene
is labeled a doctor, it should not be a point of confusion if the
person inspiring this character is not a doctor in real life.

While the improvisers will start the scene with characters, they
will still have to define the relationship between the characters
to fully establish the Who of the scene.

Note that one of the two specific characters can still function
as a “voice of reason” in this scene, even though the improviser
may be behaving very differently from his or her true self.

PURPOSE

This exercise provides another method for making
character choices.

By basing characters on people you actually know, you are more
likely to mine humor from truthful, relatable behavior.

CHARACTER ENDOWMENT

Sometimes you will be called on to create a character when someone
else makes a choice for you. Let’s say that you are a 22-year-old American
college student. You may enter into a scene neutrally, as yourself, but
then your scene partner initiates with:

“! asked you to rustle up those steer and put ‘em in the corral.”

Or

“Mr. Freemont, if you don’t take your medication, you won’t
be able to do your water aerobics class.”

Or
“Billy! Get off the jungle gym now, it’s nap time.”

In order to Yes And your scene partner in any of these situations, you
would have to immediately be the type of person implied or suggested by
their initiation. Since you are not a cowboy, an old man, or a child on a
playground, you will need to make some character choices to make your
acting in this scene believable.



If your scene partner steps out and makes a strong character choice, you
have the option of matching or mirroring this character choice. These
scenes are referred to as peas-in-a-pod scenes.
In a peas-in-a-pod scene, neither character questions or challenges
what is absurd because they both accept and agree with the absurdity
in a scene. In these scenes, it is beneficial for the characters to
acknowledge the outside, reasonable world as we know it so that
the world around them can act as a voice of reason and provide the
characters with an opportunity to explore and justify their absurd
behavior. In movies like 0122!3!"$’4/!567$22$.*!8’9$.*:+$ and ;:<=!
3!;:<=$+, or the TV show 8=/&2:*$2>!?)=:2&:/, two peas-in-a-pod
characters run through a gauntlet of voices of reason in the world as
we know it. In a peas-in-a-pod Long Form improv scene, the absurd
characters must 1<-2>!the world as we know it @:.2$//!)!*#1+’!7#)+)7*$+!
$.*$+/!)/!)!9&17$!&(!+$)/&.A. By doing this, they remind the audience of
the base reality against which the unusual is funny, and they provide
themselves with opportunities to explore their absurd behavior.
Let’s say we’re watching an Organic Scene in which this initiation has
been offered:

Since this initiation is so plainly absurd, Player 2 has the option of
responding to it as a voice of reason. But if Player 2 wants to match
characters here, he may say something like:
Player 2 has adopted the same point of view as Player 1. He has not
challenged or questioned Player 1’s initiation because he shares the
same belief.
Even though these characters have the same absurd point of view, they
have grounded the scene by reminding us of the real world through the
roommate’s objection to their theory. By defending their point of view
against the roommate’s objection, they explore their game.
Matching your scene partner’s character will sometimes help you
to start off a scene in agreement. Two peppy cheerleaders, two wild
and crazy guys, or two backwoods dimwits from the Great White
North are going to have a lot in common, which will make for easy Yes
Anding. Matching can help you start your scenes with characters that
have an implied relationship and share common experiences, beliefs,
backgrounds, etc.
This technique is best suited for Organic Scenes. In a Premise Scene,
matching can be a problematic approach. If you are doing premise-
based improv and your scene partner comes out with a strong character,
it is best to remain neutral until you know what your scene partner
wants from you. Matching could undermine the premise they want to
play with.

CHAPTER SIX - Using Character to Play Game

EXERCISE: THE CHAMELEON

INSTRUCTIONS

Six to eight improvisers get on stage and form a back-line.

One improviser will step forward and volunteer to be “the
chameleon” in 3-4 quick scenes. The chameleon will remain
center stage as 3-4 improvisers step forward, one after another,
to initiate scenes.

Without getting suggestions, each of these improvisers will
step out from the back-line and initiate a scene with a strong
character choice. The chameleon should then MATCH that
character, and they will perform a short scene.

Matching means that you play the same type of character by
taking on the same energy, beliefs, likes, dislikes, physicality,
etc. The chameleon shouldn’t repeat their scene partner’s lines;
they just need to match the character choice.

After the first chameleon has matched 3-4 characters, they
should step to the back-line, allowing another improviser to
step forward to become the next chameleon.

As the improviser coming from the back-line with a character, do
not initiate any of these scenes with a line that makes it difficult
for the chameleon to match you. (Example: An improviser steps
out playing an incredibly old woman and says, “Young man, it is
so kind of you to come visit me.” It will be difficult for the scene
partner to match this choice since they have been set up to
portray a young man.)

PURPOSE

This exercise will allow you to practice playing game in a peas-
in-a-pod scene.

This exercise is also a great way to expand your range in terms
of playing game characters. You will be forced to match choices
that your scene partners make, which may be very different
from the sort of characters you tend to play. Taking risks with
character choices in this exercise can get you out of your
comfort zone more often in scenes.

SECTION TWO * CHAPTER SEVEN

Using Support
Moves to Play
Game as a Group

Every member of an improv group should

share responsibility for the success of each and
every scene. When you are not one of the main
characters of the scene, you do this through
support work. Through listening and paying full
attention to the scene that is happening, you will
know when support is necessary and appropriate.

Through various support techniques, every
member of the ensemble can work together to
play the game of a scene. Once a game has been
found, support moves are primarily used to
clarify, heighten, or explore the game of the scene.
Support techniques allow those improvisers with
an outside perspective on the scene to contribute
to its success.

Support moves are made during scenes by the rest of the ensemble
from the back-line. Support moves are generally only made in the
service of a game. The following section will review a number of
different support moves available to you.

CHAPTER SEVEN - Using Support Moves to Play Game as a Group


A walk-on is when an improviser from the back-line enters the
scene to help find the game, play the game, or support the reality
of the scene. Walk-ons that happen before a game is found should
be done to clarify or “underline” a game that two improvisers are
close to finding but seem unclear or unsure of in some way. In these
instances, a walk-on will help the improvisers in a scene nail down
their game. Walk-ons can also be used to heighten or explore an
already established game. In some walk-ons, you will directly make
a game move. In some walk-ons, you will provide an opportunity for
the characters in the scene to make a game move. In a peas-in-a-pod
scene, a walk-on might simply offer a grounded reality against which
the strange behavior can stand out in contrast. Sometimes a walk-on
will be made to support the reality of the scene by adding a necessary
support character (e.g. a waiter in a restaurant scene or a stenographer
in a courtroom scene).

Let’s first look at an example of an improviser from the back-line
underlining a game for two people performing a scene.

EXAMPLE 1

(You are on the back-line, watching a scene in progress between a pet store
owner and a customer in a pet store. It has become clear to you that a
pattern of behavior of an absurdly cheap customer has been established,
but from the tentative nature of their play on stage, it seems that the
improvisers in the scene are unsure of the potential game. You could walk
on to this scene as the customer’s son with a line that brings into focus the
game they’ve already been playing.)

SON: (walking on) “Hey Dad, look! Alpo! That’s what we had
for dinner last night.”

CHEAP GUY: “Last night and last night only. Remember, that
was a special birthday dinner treat.”

You have not imposed your own game; you have underlined their
existing game. The last line from “Cheap Guy” indicates that he now
gets the game.

Now that all of the improvisers are on the same page, let’s look
at some examples of additional walk-ons that heighten or explore
the game.



This line has explored the game by endowing Cheap Guy with a
philosophy that explains why he thinks that Alpo is for birthdays only.
If Cheap Guy and his kids proceed to the checkout, you could walk
on to this scene by entering as a cashier. This would be an example
of a walk-on that supports the reality of the scene. The cashier may
or may not make a move that heightens or explores this game, but it
will allow Cheap Guy and his kids to move the scene forward to where
it would go next in reality. Continuing to support the reality of the
scene is how the back-line can set up the improvisers in the scene for
further game playing.
Whenever you perform a walk-on, you want to choose a character
that naturally fits into the scenario already established. The children
and the cashier in the examples above are germane to this scenario.
It is reasonable to think that this man would bring his kids shopping
with him. It is also reasonable to think that a cashier would be working
in this pet store. Having the Cheap Guy’s boss show up at the pet store

would seem coincidental and forced, even if the boss played into the
game of the customer being cheap.
Make sure that your walk-ons are supportive and altruistic, not self-
serving. You should only remain in a scene as long as is necessary to
support it and then leave. For example, while a stenographer would
remain on stage for the entirety of a courtroom scene, a waiter would
exit after taking an order. Self-serving walk-ons will derail a game that
is already in progress. For example, you may have an “old crazy cat
lady” character that you love to do. If you enter the “cheap guy” scene
as this character to say, “I need 500 pounds of cat food for my thirty
cats,” you haven’t played the “cheap guy” game; you’ve only taken an
opportunity to make the scene about you. This walk-on also fails to
support the established base reality. While it is somewhat reasonable
to think that a woman like this might be in the pet shop, this character
is distracting because it adds a new unusual element to the scene. This
would not be a supportive walk-on.
The tag-out is a support technique whereby an improviser from the
back-line takes the game of the scene to a new time (and sometimes
a new place) by substituting him or herself for one or more of the
characters already in the scene. A tag-out is communicated through a
tap on the shoulder or a wave of the hand. Someone from the back-line
tapping you on the shoulder is your signal to leave the scene and go to
the back-line. The improviser that tagged you out will enter as a brand
new character and essentially start a new scene playing the same game
with the improviser that was not tagged out. The improviser left in the
scene continues playing the same character.

You should only tag into a scene with the intention of heightening
or exploring the game. After tagging in, make any changes to the
Who, What, and Where very clear with a strong, physical choice and
a concise, clear first line. Doing so will ensure that your scene partner
understands the new context in which you wish to play the game.

You can tag out either character in a scene as long as you bring the
game into the next scene. You want to ask yourself, “What is another
situation that I can place one of these characters to continue to play the
game of this scene?”

It is up to the rest of the back-line to determine the length of a tag-
out. Some tag-outs will develop into full scenes, whereas others may be
played out after only a few exchanges. It is your job on the back-line to
get your teammates out of the scene when their idea has run its course.
Once tag-outs start, you should always be thinking, “What is another
new situation in which to play this game?”

Let’s return to the “cheap guy” scene for an example of a tag-out:

EXAMPLE 1

(Let’s imagine that the game has been clearly established with only the pet
store owner and “cheap guy” on stage. Watching from the back-line, you
tag out the improviser playing the pet store owner to play a doctor.)

DOCTOR: “Weare going to have to operate on your heart.
Because of insurance, it will actually only be
fifteen dollars.”

CHEAP GUY: “Fifteen dollars?! I’d rather die tomorrow than
be robbed today!”

(The scene can either continue from this point, or another improviser can
tag in to put the cheap guy into another situation.)

SON: “Dad, look! A wishing well! Can | have a penny to
throw in?”

CHEAP GUY: “A penny? No honey. Daddy is not made of

Tag-outs should only be used to play the game of the scene. Every tag-
out that happens in this series of scenes should focus on heightening or
exploring how cheap the character is.



CHAPTER SEVEN - Using Support Moves to Play Game as a Group

Now let’s look at some bad examples that do not play the game:
EXAMPLE 2

(Let’s imagine that once again, the game has been clearly established with
only the pet store owner and “cheap guy” on stage. Watching from the
back-line, you tag out the improviser playing cheap guy to play the pet-
store owner’s wife.)

WIFE: “How was work today, dear?”

PETSTORE “Pretty typical. Although | did have one
OWNER: customer who was incredibly cheap.”

This is a bad tag-out because we're not playing the game, we’re merely
referencing it. This is a tag-out that is following the plot of the pet-store
owner, not the game of being severely cheap.

Let’s take a look at another tag-out that doesn’t work.
EXAMPLE 3

(Let’s imagine that once again, the game has been clearly established with
only the pet store owner and “cheap guy” on stage. Watching from the
back-line, you tag out the improviser playing the pet store owner to play
the cheap guy’s wife.)

WIFE: “Honey, don’t forget. Katie’s parent teacher
conference is this Friday.”

CHEAP GUY: “Hopefully her teacher will be able to explain why
she’s having so much trouble with math lately.”

Again, this tag-out is following the plot of Cheap Guy’s life. We are not
interested in the story of his life; we are interested in seeing other
situations in which he gets to be ridiculously cheap. Tagging in as his
wife could potentially lead to playing the game, but the improviser
playing the wife needs to make choices—about what they are discussing
or where the scene is taking place—that will focus on the “cheap” game.

Let’s look at another tag-out featuring cheap guy’s wife that is on game.
EXAMPLE 4

(Let’s imagine that once again, the game has been clearly established with



only the pet store owner and “cheap guy” on stage. Watching from the
back-line, you tag out the improviser playing the pet store owner to play
the cheap guy’s wife.)

WIFE: “Honey, putting a tent in the yard is not a vacation.”

CHEAP GUY: “What if! play this tape of ocean sounds on
my old boom-box?”

A series of tag-outs in quick succession is referred to as a tag-out run. In
a good tag-out run, the back-line will be mindful of the length of each
new tag-out. In a bad tag-out run, a new tag-out will happen before an
idea is given a chance to play out in the previous scene or tag-out. Be
sure that you allow the person remaining in the scene to respond to each
new tag-out before tagging in again. You don’t want to let the ongoing
scene get hijacked with tag-outs. Give each new tag-out scene the length
of time it needs to be successful before offering another tag-out, whether
that ends up being two lines or two minutes.

A good tag-out run will heighten the game. Let’s imagine a scene
in a Laundromat. A man is late to pick up his shirt. The lady working
there explains that since they are busy and have such little space, she
destroyed it. Another improviser tags in to play a woman who is late
to pick up her wedding dress. Again, it has been destroyed. Another
improviser tags in to play a father who says, “Thanks for watching my
son. I’m sorry I took longer than five minutes. Where is he?” The woman
from the Laundromat explains that she killed the son due to being
busy and a lack of space. All of these tags follow the same logic while
heightening the game.

SPLIT SCENES

A split scene is a technique that allows you to perform two scenes on
stage simultaneously. These scenes usually take place in the same time
frame but always in separate locations. A split scene happens when two
improvisers from the back-line initiate another scene that is somehow
relevant to the scene already in progress without ending the original
scene. A good time to use split scenes is when someone in the original
scene refers to something interesting or important to the game that is
taking place somewhere else, usually at the same time.

When you are initiating a split scene, you can cue another
improviser to join you by making eye contact with them. You cue
another improviser by grabbing their arm, stepping downstage
and to the side of the existing scene already in progress without
acknowledging it. Stepping downstage is important so that any
improvisers already on stage can see you. If you were to start a split
scene behind the improvisers on stage, they might assume that you



are occupying the same physical space as their characters. A strong
initiating line or a physical choice that clearly does not fit the logic of
the scene already happening will also serve as a cue to the improvisers
on stage that a split scene is starting. As the improvisers performing the
split scene begin talking, the other improvisers should fall silent and
begin miming as they listen to the new scene. The improvisers in both
scenes must give and take focus.

The following is an example of a split scene:

EXAMPLE 1

PLAYER 1: “Mom and Dad said | get to play a game before |
go to bed.”

PLAYER 2: “Yeah, yeah, they told me when we went over
the emergency numbers. You know how to
play quarters?”

(From the back-line, Player 3 initiates a split scene. Player 3 makes

eye contact with two other improvisers from the back-line. All three
improvisers step downstage off of the back-line without acknowledging
the improvisers in the scene already in progress. Player 3 mimes holding a
drink. Players 4 and 5 mirror this choice.)



A cut-to is an improv technique that allows you to jump time and
location to a new scene as you would in a film. a cut-to will also
often include a description of what is happening in the new time and
location. You will specify exactly where and/or when you are cutting
to (e.g. “Cut to the north pole, three years later,” or “Cut to graduation
day, three weeks earlier”). A cut-to always sets up a new scene that is
somehow connected to or inspired by the scene that came before it.
When calling a cut-to from the back-line, it often helps to join the
scene you have cut to and initiate the first line to communicate how
you think the game can be played in this new time and location. Let’s
imagine the game of the scene involves a woman accusing a middle-aged
man of trying to act younger than his age by pointing out his dyed hair,
new sports car, skinny jeans, etc. Someone from the back-line says, “We
cut to a ball pit at McDonald’s,” steps into the scene, and says, “Sir, I’m
sorry, but you need to be four years or younger to be in the play area.”
The new scene that we cut to can involve all of the same characters
in a different time or place, one of the characters in a different time or
place, or completely new characters in a different time or place. The
new scenario that we cut to should always follow the game of the scene,
not the plot or story.
A cut-to can be used when the improvisers in a scene are discussing
something specific that has happened in the past or will happen in
the future. If it would be more interesting to see this new scenario as
opposed to just talking about it, an improviser from the back-line can
initiate a cut-to. The new scene we cut to should be playing the game
already established.
For example, if two improvisers in a scene mention going to the
prom, and it seems like this new location would help them play their
game, you can shout out, “We cut to the prom!” from the back-line. The
two improvisers will be at the prom instantaneously so that they can
continue to play their game in a new location.

The time and location that you cut to doesn’t need to have been
mentioned by the improvisers in the scene. If, while on the back-line,
you can come up with a time and place that would help the improvisers
play their game, it is valid to cut to this scenario. Let’s say you are on the
back-line watching a scene in which the game involves one roommate
complaining to another about his decision to decorate their apartment
with Satanic symbols. Cutting to the future, wherein the complaining
kid invites his girlfriend over for a romantic evening, could provide a
strong new opportunity to play this game.
Another benefit of the cut-to is the elimination of moments
that would exist in the “reality” of the scene but do not add to the
comedy of the scene. For instance, a cut-to can help you skip the
anesthesiologist’s drive to the hospital where he is going to anesthetize
a patient with a brick.
Remember that you can always “cut back” to the scene that you
originally cut away from by simply yelling, “we cut back to _______.” You
would do this if the joke of the cut-to has been exhausted or if there is
more to explore in the original scene.
Cut-tos should be used sparingly. You should not use a cut-to before
a game has been found or something unusual has been mentioned.
Furthermore, this technique shouldn’t be used every time an
improviser in a scene has mentioned another location—it should only
be used in instances when cutting to that new location will provide an
opportunity for the game of the scene to be played. Do not use a cut-to
to advance the plot of the scene; you should only cut to new situations
in which the game can be played.
Scene painting, like the cut-to, is another support technique borrowed
from screenwriting. Scene painting allows you to add the sort of
description you would find in a screenplay to an improv scene. Scene
painting is editorial narration that allows an improviser from the back-
line to add visual details to a scene that enhance the game. Note: these
details must be visual. Let’s imagine that you are describing a woman
in a scene. You could scene paint and say, “We see that she is dressed in
business attire,” but you shouldn’t say something like, “We see that she
is extremely smart,” since we can’t, in fact, visually “see” this.
In order to scene paint, an improviser from the back-line steps
forward and describes these details directly to the audience. To add
specificity, an improviser may even walk around and gesture to the
details that they are describing in the physical space. An improviser
cannot paint the scene when they are in it.
For instance, in the Satanic decoration scene hinted at in the
previous section, an improviser from the back-line could step forward
and say, “On this wall, we see that 666 has been written in dried blood.

At the other end of the room, there is a makeshift alter, on top of which
there is an inverted crucifix and an animal’s skull. The characters are
standing on top of a pentagram throw-rug.” Note that the characters in
the scene don’t hear these words. The improviser from the back-line
has just given the audience rich visuals that relate to the game of the
scene. Scene painting may also provide the improvisers in the scene
with new specifics to play their game. The characters in the scene can
now notice these visual details and react to them.
Don’t scene paint to add in details that do not relate to the game
of the scene. You wouldn’t want to scene paint the Satanic decoration
scene by saying, “We see a lamp,” or, “We see that there are windows in
this room,” because these details don’t directly play the game.
When using Scene Painting as a support move, it can also be called
a lay-on.
Improvisers can also support a scene by supplying sound effects from
the back-line. Sound effects should be made to sound as “true to life” as

possible. They can be added to the scene by any improviser standing on
the back-line.
Sound effects are supportive when they enhance the reality of
the scene. For example, if we are watching a scene take place on a
battlefield, the sounds of gunfire and explosions could serve to enhance
the reality of the scene. If a character in a scene turns on a radio or a
television, you can support the reality of that scene by providing music
or dialogue from the back-line. Improvisers from the back-line can also
provide the dialogue for a movie being watched by two characters in a
movie theater.
Sound effects can also directly play into the game of the scene. If we
are seeing a game about an animal trainer who claims to be good with
animals but isn’t, it would be on game for the back-line to provide the
sound effect of growling dogs and hissing cats.
You don’t want to overuse sounds effects or add any to the scene
that could potentially be distracting from the game of the scene. Never
use sounds effects to make jokes outside the game. For example,
having a doorbell ring for an unusually long time would be jokey and
unsupportive to the improvisers in the scene. Sound effects don’t
necessarily need to be jokey to be distracting. For example, if a character
in the scene opens a cabinet, making a creaking sound would not
enhance the scene or help play the game in any way. Even supportive
sound effects that enhance the reality of the scene can possibly take over
the scene. You also always have the option to fade out sound effects after
a few moments in order to avoid stealing focus.
Improvisers from the back-line can support the scene by playing
offstage characters that we hear but do not see. Offstage characters are
like walk-ons that never actually walk on.
Offstage characters often are used when a character in the scene
receives a telephone call. An improviser can play the other end of the
phone conversation by talking from the back-line.
Sometimes, the characters in the scene will mention offstage
characters. Let’s return to the Cheap Guy scene for an example of this:

In this instance, this improviser was able to contribute to the scene and
play the game without ever actually entering the scene.
As with all support moves, offstage characters should be used
sparingly. We don’t need to hear from every character referred to by the
characters in the scene. Those characters that we do hear from should
justify or enhance the game of the scene in some way. Be sure not to
hijack the scene that is happening on stage with offstage characters.
Improvisers can flesh out the environment in a scene by playing
inanimate objects and animals. Adding these elements to a scene can
enrich the world in which the scene is taking place and give the other
improvisers something real to react to.

It isn’t necessary to play animals every time that they are mentioned.
If your team were performing a scene about a cat that is unusually
strong, seeing this cat knock over furniture and wreak havoc would be
playing into the game of the scene. Playing a cat would be more of a
distraction in a scene like our Cheap Guy scene, which takes place in
a pet store. The cat is not especially relevant to the game, and seeing
someone play this cat would be distracting.
Improvisers should play physical objects only when they contribute
to the scene or game in some significant way. There was an improv
group in New York that once did a scene about newlyweds on their
honeymoon. After discussing whether or not they should get on the
cheap-looking, coin-operated vibrating bed in their motel room, the six
improvisers from the back-line entered the scene and physically built a
vibrating bed using their bodies. It ended up being an inspired moment
of support that made the scene stronger. If your team is performing a
scene that takes place in a casino, stepping out from the back-line to
play a slot machine is probably only going to distract the improvisers
from finding a game in this scene. Even if a game has already been
found, the slot machine is an incidental object that will not add to the
funny ideas being explored on stage.
As with all support techniques, playing any inanimate object,
animal, or anything else that doesn’t talk should only support the scene
in progress. You don’t want to distract the improvisers in the scene or
steal focus. Be selective in deciding when to portray objects or animals.
Don’t play incidental objects that have no impact on what the scene is
really about. For example, if two people in a scene are eating dinner, we
don’t need to see another improviser play their table. If an improviser
mentions that he or she is wearing a hat, it would be excessive and
unnecessary for someone from the back-line to play the hat. Physical
support moves should be made to put the focus on what is interesting
about the game of the scene.
Improvisers from the back-line can physically support their teammates
in a scene in order to show things on stage that would otherwise be
physically impossible to do alone. Improvisers can work together to
allow the performers in a scene to do anything that they can imagine.
For example, if two improvisers were to initiate a scene set on a
spaceship, the back-line could help them simulate weightlessness by
physically picking the improvisers up and carrying them as the scene
continues. Now let’s imagine a scene in which two improvisers board
an amusement park ride. Instead of letting the improvisers sit in
motionless chairs, improvisers from the back-line could lift the chairs
into the air and move them in a circular path, simulating the spinning
action of an amusement park ride. If we are watching a scene about a

superhero, the rest of the ensemble can simulate flight by lifting the
improviser playing the superhero into the air and moving him or her
through the space.
It is important to be careful when attempting to do any sort of
physical support move. You want to be mindful of your own safety,
as well as the safety of the members of your group that you will be
physically handling. If you are uncomfortable with physical contact
due to injuries or any other reason, let your teammates know prior
to performance.
Supporting your teammates on stage should be your top priority
whenever you are performing Long Form. Great improvisers do
whatever they can to make everyone else on stage look good. Often,
the best way to support a scene from the back-line is to do nothing at
all. Keep this in mind whenever you use any of the support techniques
mentioned in this section. Only use these techniques to enhance the
existing scene. Don’t use these techniques to take over someone else’s
scene and make it about you. Be sure that you are always supporting
the game your scene partners have established.
Editing is possibly the most important form of support you can practice
in a Long Form show. An edit is any technique used to signify the end
of a scene. Every improv scene must come to an end at some point, and
it is up to the improvisers on stage to determine when that ending will
come. A well-timed edit that allows two improvisers to end a scene on a
high note can make a great scene seem even more amazing.
One of the greatest compliments that an improviser can get is when
they are asked if the scene they just performed was written. If an
audience member has asked this, it is probably because the scene was
funny, smart, and economical. An edit that ends a scene on a big laugh
will make the scene feel like a well-written sketch.
Some beginning improvisers will be hesitant to edit because they
are afraid to stop a scene that seems to be going really well. However,
the improvisers performing the scene want you to edit at a heightened
point, not after it has petered out. Don’t think of editing a scene while
it was going well as truncating a good scene; think of it as taking the
scene out on a high note. You have left the audience with a picture of
two improvisers succeeding, as opposed to two improvisers struggling.
The goal of every improviser should always be to make others look
good and to make every scene in the show as strong as possible. A
well-timed edit is a way for improvisers on the back-line to do both of
these things.

The success of an edit depends on its timing. You want to edit scenes at
a high point, preferably on a big laugh line. A scene shouldn’t be edited
on the very first big laugh, but after the improvisers in the scene have
been allowed to heighten and explore their game a few times. If the
scene has been consistently getting laughs, and a game move gets a
great reaction from the audience, this is a good time to edit the scene.
There will come a point in any scene when the improvisers will run out
of options for further heightening. You want to be carefully watching
the other members of your group from the back-line. In a perfect
scenario, you would edit the scene when they reach a point at which
you think, “Wow, they just heightened this game as far as it can go.”
Since every scene is different, when to edit must be decided on a
case-by-case basis. You should be watching every scene actively. If,
while on the back-line, you can easily think of multiple additional
game moves for the scene that is happening, you can assume that
the improvisers in the scene feel the same way. In this case, you can
afford to give the scene more time before you edit. If you watch a
scene and you can’t think of how you would further heighten it, you
want to again assume that the improvisers in the scene feel the same
way, and you would want to provide an edit as soon as possible. Some
scenes will “supernova,” meaning the improvisers will find a game
quickly, play it aggressively, and the whole thing will be done in a
minute. Other scenes will last longer because the players have a lot of
ideas to heighten and explore, or they are receiving a lot of support
from the back-line. In either case, you want to get a sense for when
the improvisers are approaching the limits of heightening their game
when deciding on an edit.
A good rule of thumb: if you’re thinking that you should edit, you
probably should have edited thirty seconds ago. This will help you avoid
the state of panic wherein you watch your fellow performers struggle in
a scene with nowhere else left to go. In this situation, the improvisers
have heightened and explored their game to the point where the
scene has started to plateau. If the improvisers have started to repeat
information, the scene may be starting to flat-line. A flat-lining scene
is one where the edit has been missed. If you miss an edit, give the
scene another thirty seconds. If you get a laugh during the next thirty
seconds, edit on the laugh. If at the end of those thirty seconds there
hasn’t been another laugh, cut your losses and edit anyway.
It is best to follow your instincts when editing. If you have the
impulse to edit, follow that impulse. Don’t ever start to edit and then
hesitate. Improvisers are sometimes hesitant to edit a scene because
they are afraid of cutting a scene short. Remember, you are editing to
take a scene out on a high note and prevent it from petering out.
Obviously, you want to edit a scene before the improvisers being
spinning their wheels. If you wait too long after a scene has peaked to

edit, you could turn a great scene, which could have ended with a bang,
into a decent scene that fizzles out. A scene that ends poorly because of
a missed edit can have a devastating effect on your entire show.
Now that you know when to edit, let’s discuss how to edit. There
are many different styles of editing in the world of Long Form
improvisation. Your group should choose the style that fits the aesthetic
of your show. To avoid confusion, the style of edit should be agreed
upon prior to performance, not found during the course of a show. No
matter how you choose to edit, the most important thing is to be clear.
Communication of the edit to everyone on stage is important. The other
improvisers on stage must know that you are editing.
The improvisers on the back-line should take responsibility for
editing the scenes. This allows the improvisers in the scene to be able
to focus on and fully commit to their performances. Remember, every
member of an improv group shares responsibility for the success of

each and every scene. Editing is the one form of support that is always
required from the back-line in order for a scene to be successful. By
listening and paying full attention to the scene that is happening, you
will know when a scene should be edited.
Editing from within the scene is referred to as self-editing.
Self-editing is necessary when every member of your ensemble is
performing in a group scene. "M*/-0!,.#+#,!’(88!5#!:(,.-,,#:!=-*)1#*!(+!)1#!
,#.)(/+!/+!@/+%!E/*2!,)*-.)-*#,$3 It is possible to self-edit in two person
scenes. However, we recommend that you don’t, because it will take
your focus off of playing the game, and the audience may perceive the
self-edit as you bailing on your scene.
The most common style of edit is the sweep edit. An improviser
from the back-line will sweep edit a scene by stepping out from the
back-line and moving across the stage in front of the improvisers
performing the scene. This improviser has broken through the reality
of the scene, effectively “sweeping” the stage clean of the scene that was
happening. This is a cue to all improvisers on stage that the scene is
over, and that it is time to begin a new scene.

SECTION TWO * CHAPTER SEVEN

returning to the back-line again. You have signaled to your team that
the scene is over, and by returning to the back-line, you have let them
know that you don’t have an idea for another scene. Therefore, two new
improvisers should step forward to start the next scene.

If you know that it is time to edit and you do have an idea for a scene,
you should sweep the scene, but instead of returning to the back-line,
remain on stage and wait for another improviser to join you.

The sweep edit is only one of many styles of editing. Some
improvisers edit by breaking directly through the middle of the scene to
begin a new one. Some improvisers use stomping, clapping, or saying,
“freeze!” to signal the end of one scene and the start of the next. The
editing style you choose will depend on the preference of the group. As
long as the edit is agreed upon by all members of the ensemble and clear
in its execution, it will be effective.

Take editing seriously. Remember, editing is a form of support, and
supporting your teammates should always be your number one priority
on stage. Editing is another tool for making the other members of your
team look good.

Hints &
Hazards

There are certain “rules” that a
new improviser will constantly
hear throughout his or her training
in Long Form. Many of these rules
come in the form of “don'ts.” There
are certain choices, scenarios,

and situations that can lead to
troublesome and unsuccessful
scenes for new improvisers.

These improv rules exist to steer
new improvisers towards making
choices that will help them
successfully find a game in a scene.
Listed below are some of these
rules and scenic taboos.

Topics covered:
¢ Identify “it,” and don’t give unnamed presents
« “Good” questions versus “bad” questions
¢ Don’t follow plot
¢ Don’t talk about the thing
¢ Don’t talk about characters who aren’t there

¢ Don’t talk about the past or future: Keep scene
in the present

¢ Don’t talk about what you are doing
¢ Don’t reach into your bag of tricks

« Avoiding teaching and transaction scenes



Rules
of Thumb
Sometimes, you may make the mistake of focusing the scene’s attention
on an object without having a clear idea of what the object is. The best
thing to do in this situation is to identify “it.” You don’t want to let the
scene become about guessing what “it” is.
You can avoid this problem by making strong, clear choices. If you
can manage to avoid the words “this,” “these,” “those,” “that,” and “it”
at the tops of scenes—in favor of more specific choices—you will keep
yourself from falling prey to this problem. Using these words only
delays the inevitable naming of what they represent and slows the
scene down.
The longer you talk about an unidentified “it,” the greater the
audience’s expectations become for “it” to be hilarious. The “it” will
become a bigger and bigger mystery, and will become the focus of the
scene. You and your scene partner will find yourselves distracted by
“it,” and you will be kept from finding out what is truly funny about
the scene. The sooner you make a choice about “it,” the sooner you
can move on with the scene to discover what is interesting about your
relationship or your character’s behavior.
If you never identify “it,” you will force yourself into a scene in
which the “game” can only be based on vagueness.

If you find yourself in a scene where your scene partner has used “it”
or another equally vague word, take the initiative and identify “it” as
quickly as you can. For example, let’s say your partner initiates a scene
by looking offstage, saying:

“Look at that!”

If you find yourself in a scene like this, where your partner has offered a
poor initiation using “it” or another equally vague word, you will need to
take the initiative. By doing so, you might respond with:

“Wow. Alan has really let himself go since the divorce.”

Now, you and your scene partner can move on with the scene, Yes
Anding off of this information about your friend Alan. If your scene
partner wasn’t picturing “Alan,” he must now. Once something is said
on stage, it is a reality. If your scene partner did have something more
specific in mind, he must drop his idea and go with yours.

THE PROBLEM WITH GIVING PRESENTS

N ew improvisers will sometimes give their scene partner a present
in a scene without saying what it is. While this more closely
mirrors reality (you don’t tell someone what their present is before
they open it), it ultimately leaves your scene partner in the dark as to
how to react. You don’t want to end up with a guessing game about
what the present is.

The best way to avoid this issue is to blurt out what the present is
as itis being opened. This way, you are letting the other improviser
know how you expect them to play into your idea. For example, if
you intend to play a thoughtless husband, identify your present

as being something disappointing so that your scene partner can
react accordingly.

Remember, being in agreement is the key to success in Long Form
improv. The sooner you can agree with your scene partner about what
“it” is, the sooner you will be able to work together to find what is funny
about your scene.

THE TRUTH ABOUT QUESTIONS

In the world of improvisation, there is an often-misunderstood dictum:
“Don't ask questions.” This is often misunderstood to mean that you can
never ask a question when improvising. In fact, “Don’t ask questions”



is a rule that only applies to the start of a Long Form scene. When you
initiate a scene with your partner and begin to discover the world of
your scene through Yes And, questions will not provide you with more
information about this world. As we have already discussed, questions
can prevent you from clearly establishing the base reality of your scene
(who you are, what you are doing, and where you are). Questions will
also most likely stall the discovery of the first unusual thing. Constantly
asking questions at the top of a scene will keep you from creating
characters with strong viewpoints. Questions at the start of a scene are
unfair to your scene partner, as they put the onus of creation on him or
her. You force your scene partner to do all of the decision-making for
both of you.
For example, let’s imagine that you started a scene by saying, “What
do you want to do today?” This initiation hasn’t offered any information
to the scene. You are not making any choices; you are forcing your
scene partner to do so. Remember, at the start of the scene, neither
of you knows who you are, where you are, or what you’re doing. If you
have the impulse to ask your scene partner a question, force yourself
to just make a choice and turn your question into a statement. For
instance, instead of “What do you want to do today?” you could say,
“I thought we’d go for a bike ride.” Your scene partner might have the
impulse to reply, “Where do you want to go?” but the scene will be
better off with a statement like, “Let’s ride down to the art museum.”
It is important to distinguish between questions that delay the
discovery of the game and questions that come from an improviser
playing the scene truthfully in service of the game of the scene. There
are good questions and bad questions in Long Form improv. A good
question will often come as a reaction to the unusual and provide an
opportunity for your scene partner to justify the absurd. These sorts
of questions (previously described as “framing” the unusual thing in a
scene), will actually often serve as the best way to support the choice
your scene partner has just made.
Remember, asking a question is definitely okay once you and your
scene partner have found the game of the scene. Since we ask questions
all the time in real life, doing so in a scene may be the best way to play a
specific moment at the top of your intelligence.
Questions asked in order to explore the game don’t merely have
to “tee up” your scene partner to provide exploration. The questions
you ask can themselves help add to the exploration in a scene. Let’s
look back at our scene in which the dentist uses a brick to anesthetize
his patients. One of the questions asked by the “voice of reason” in
the scene was, “Is it a medical grade brick? Like one that is sized and
proportionate to my weight?” In this case, the question explores, “If a
patient is told that he is going to be hit by a brick, then why would he
choose to stay in this office?” The question shows why a patient might
give this dentist the benefit of the doubt. If this scene went further, the

voice of reason might ask, “Is this why your fee is so low?” This question
brings a new dimension to the game. If a brick is used to anesthetize,
then costs related to traditional anesthesia, assistants, and monitoring
machines would have all been eliminated.
The following section will review common scenarios that tend to
be troublesome for new improvisers. This section will also review
common beginner tendencies that hurt scenes. By making you aware
of these “traps,” we hope that you will have a better chance of fixing the
scene when you do fall into them.
New improvisers will often hear the note, “You ended up following the
plot in that scene.” We are not interested in the story of a Long Form
comedy scene; we are interested in the game. We are not creating
a play with a story arc. We are not interested in finding a strong
beginning, middle, and end, and we aren’t improvising to discover
what is going to change about our characters. We are improvising
comedy sketches, not stories.
To create something that resembles a comedic sketch, you need to
follow the game of the scene. In order to do this, you need to begin by
finding what is unusual in the world we have created. A big trap that
many new improvisers fall into is running past the unusual to follow
the story of the characters instead. This will lead to an artificial and
mostly arbitrary creation of facts and plot points, as opposed to a clear
pattern of behavior that can be built and sustained through heightening
and exploration !"#$"%&’.
Improvisers sometimes inadvertently fall into following plot by
endlessly Yes Anding after blowing past the first unusual thing. When
this happens, you are likely to end up following the story of your

unnecessarily complicated characters and situation by default. These
kinds of scenes will often start out fun, but they will quickly run out of
steam because there is no pattern to ease the burden of creativity.
As with most rules in Long Form, there is an exception when it
comes to plot.#()**)+,-$#.*)/#,-#/0&#1&23,4&#)5#"#$"%& is acceptable.
Let’s say that you start with a scene in which you are playing a lawyer
preparing a client for trial. The game of the scene is that this lawyer is
uncomfortable speaking in public. In this case, it may be easiest to use
plot to play this game. As always, you should be thinking, “Where else
could I take this lawyer so that I can continue to play this game?” It so
happens that in this case, following the story of a trial would provide
new opportunities to play your game !&6$6#1&*&4/,-$#"#7829:#.2&1&-/,-$#9)82#
4"1&#,-#4)82/:#)2#1.&";,-$#/)#/0&#-&+1#%&<,"’. These are all plot points, but
they are plot points that allow for further game moves. Plots should not
be followed to arbitrarily tell a story. Plots should be followed only if
they present further opportunities to play the game.
The main reason we don’t attempt to create improvised stories and
plots is that it is simply too difficult. Great stories require a blueprint, as
well as intricate planning and forethought. Since you are creating your
scenes from moment to moment, you are not able to look at anything
as a whole in this way. Put your focus on what is interesting or unusual
right now. Once you are able to justify the unusual or absurd, you can
make a pattern out of this behavior.
Improvised stories tend to come off as silly, unbelievable, or
unoriginal clichés. In Long Form comedic improvisation, what keeps
the audience engaged is not +0&2& the story will go, but rather 0)+#
the funny game will be heightened and explored. If you find yourself
following plot in the moment, try to re-focus yourself on creating
patterns and following behavior.
Scenes that become about “the thing” are difficult to execute, because
you and your scene partner will find yourself standing around talking
about “the thing” until, by necessity, the fact that you are doing so
becomes your game. You will have spent so much time talking about
“pizza” that this behavior has become your unusual thing. Now your
game is “people who obsessively talk about pizza.” Instead of giving
the audience a character with a specific behavior or point of view,
they are stuck watching you and your scene partner talk about a
“thing.” Ultimately, scenes that revolve around a “thing” will lack any
action or heightening.
If you find yourself in a scene where you are talking about a thing,
you can salvage the scene by forcing yourself to say some lines that
start with the words “I,” “you,” or “we.” This will hopefully move you
away from the thing and put the focus on the characters in the scene.

DON’T TALK ABOUT CHARACTERS WHO ARE NOT THERE

Another common mistake that new improvisers will make is talking
about characters that are not in the scene. For instance, in the example
scene in which characters were talking about their friend Alan, the
improvisers may be headed for trouble if they spend the entire scene
talking about Alan.

If you spend your scene talking about somebody that is not present,
all of your strongest specifics will be tied to a character that is not
presently on stage. This character is likely to become more interesting
than the two people just talking about him or her. Your audience would
probably much rather see a scene featuring this interesting character.

As with scenes about “blank,” the way to remedy these scenes is
to make strong choices about yourself and/or your scene partner.
Remember, you can do this by saying lines that start with the words
“1,” “you,” or “we.” This will help the audience to become more actively
engaged with the two characters on stage. Another possible fix to a
scene that becomes about an off-stage character is to support the scene
by walking on as the character being talked about, or to cut to a scene
featuring that character.

EXERCISE: |, YOU, WE SCENES

INSTRUCTIONS

Two improvisers take the stage.

Someone else gives them a one-word suggestion to inspire
their scene.

Each line of the scene must be a statement starting with the
word “1,” “You,” or “We.”

The improvisers should also look to incorporate the word
“because” whenever possible in order to offer justifications.

An outside person watching the scene can suspend the |/You/
We rule once he or she feels the improvisers in the scene have
discovered a game.

PURPOSE

This exercise will force you to keep the focus of the scene on its
two characters, and to avoid the trap of talking about people
who are not there.

This exercise also will give you a chance to practice exploring
by justifying the choices you make.



Another scenic trap is talking about things that have happened in the
past or things that will happen in the future.
When you do this, you often end up with a talking heads scene.
Nothing really happens in a talking heads scene besides standing
around and talking.
When you talk about the past or the future in scenes, you are often
making very interesting or specific choices about these periods of time.
These interesting moments in the past or future are where your current
scene should have started in the first place.
When you have the impulse to start your scene by reminiscing or
talking about the future, tailor your initiation to actively show this idea
instead of talking about it. For example, if you had the impulse to start
a scene by coming out and reminiscing about what an ass you were
at a party last night, you could instead start your scene at the party.
Remember, if you are talking about the past or future, you can’t be
active in the present.
If you find yourself watching a scene in which all the improvisers
do is talk about the past or future, you can take action from the back-
line. You can remedy the problem from the back-line by cutting to the
moment being discussed. Brief moments of talking about the past or
future are okay since this often happens in real life. What you want to
avoid is making your entire scene about talking about the past of future.
You don’t want to spend an entire scene with the characters just talking
about what they are doing. Some new improvisers will spend an entire
scene doing nothing but talking about what they and their scene
partners are doing. If you are doing a scene where two mechanics are
fixing a car, you don’t want to spend the whole scene talking about
fixing the car. You will want to find out what is interesting about the
characters and their relationship.
There are two main reasons why talking about what you are doing is
problematic. First, you will get caught up in plot as opposed to finding a
game. You will find that every line will be tied to the various steps of the
procedure or activity in which you are engaged, and you will miss the
specific or interesting details that could lead you to your game.
Second, talking about what you are doing keeps you from finding
game because it prevents you from playing things realistically. In real
life, people rarely talk about what they are doing as they are doing
it. This is especially true for scenes taking place at work or any other
situation where an activity is performed routinely. Two characters
performing a task that they know very well would almost never spend
their time talking about the task at hand. Having realistic and normal

conversations is more likely to lead you to interesting choices about
behavior or point of view. That, in turn, will lead you to a game.
This is not to say that giving your characters an activity to engage
with during a scene is bad. In fact, starting with an activity can be a
great way to ground your scene in a reality while also establishing your
Where through showing and not telling. Just let this be a detail in your
scene that leads you to a strong game. We want you to establish a What
for your scene, but don’t make this activity the sole focus and subject
matter of your scene.
To remedy this problem when it happens, stay engaged with the
activity while starting to talk about something else. If you find yourself
getting caught up in the “what” of the scene, put the focus on the
characters in the scene. There are a number of ways that you can do
this. Give yourself a point of view and find a way to express it. Make a
statement about how the other character seems to be feeling. Confess
something important. These are all ways that you can begin to take your
scene away from the What to make it about the most important thing in
the scene, the two improvisers we can see on stage.
Bag of tricks refers to things that you have done in the past that you
know will get a positive response from your audience, whether it’s
a character, a premise, or a joke. Forcing something from your bag
of tricks into a scene when it is not organically called for will always
undermine the integrity of the scene and also foster distrust in your
ensemble. For example, you wouldn’t want to force singing into a scene
just because you know you have a great singing voice.
When performing organic improv, there are some types of scenes that
are problematic for beginning improvisers. While it is not impossible to
find a game in these scenarios, new students of Long Form are usually
better off avoiding these “black hole” scenes.
In a teaching scene, one improviser lacks the knowledge necessary to
participate in an activity. The scene ends up being dominated by one
character who dispenses commands and instructions to the ignorant

character. It is very difficult for the improviser “being taught” to Yes
And or generate new information in such scenes because they are stuck
waiting for their “teacher” to provide instruction.
These scenes are sometimes referred to as puppet master scenes,
since one improviser ends up essentially dictating the actions of the
other. These scenes are hard to build because they are lopsided. One
improviser is responsible for the majority of the choices being made
while the other improviser is forced to just do what he or she is told.
In these scenes, since only one person is creating information, you are
losing 50% of your opportunities for finding the first unusual thing.
Instead of finding a game, the scene will be bogged down by endless
questions, corrections, and instructions.
Teaching scenes can be black holes for new improvisers, as they
necessitate your doing many of the things we have already told you to
avoid. In teaching scenes, you will end up talking about what you are
doing, talking about the thing, asking lots of questions, etc.
A subset of the teaching scene is the you gotta do it scene. These
are scenes where one character is constantly doing something wrong,
and the other character does nothing but “fix” the problem. No matter
what their scene partner does, the “teacher” ends up saying things like,
“No! You gotta do it like this.” In these scenes, one person is bulldozing
while the other person is passive. !=-#,%.2)3,1&2#,1#>8**<)?,-$#+0&-#0&#)2#
,-#"#14&-&6’ It is very difficult to make new discoveries in you-gotta-do-it
scenes. The lack of new information will make it impossible for you to
find a game.
It is important to note that avoiding teaching scenes does not
mean that we need to avoid playing a teacher in a scene. You can play
teachers and set scenes in classrooms. You just want to avoid making
the entire scene about teaching something to someone else. Make
specific choices about the character that will lead to a game beyond his
or her profession, which should only be a detail in your scene.
Choose to know how to do things in scenes even if you don’t know
how to do them in real life. Don’t make it your first day on the job. Don’t
say that you’ve “never done this before.” Choose to know. By using
what little you know about an endeavor, you will be able to fake it well
enough to convince the audience.
Sometimes you will feel like you know absolutely nothing about a
profession you are called upon to play in a scene. In these situations,
try to draw on knowledge that you’ve gained from fictional sources like
books, plays, television, or movies. If you still feel at a loss for specifics
or details related to this profession, you usually can come up with at
least a basic term or an action to start with. For example, even though
you may know nothing about being a mechanic, you could still use the
word “muffler,” open the hood of the car, etc.

When you and your scene partner can contribute to the scene
equally, you will be in a better position to find a game.
Organic scenes starting with simple transactions can also end up
being black holes for beginning improvisers. Simple transactions
are problematic because in real life they are usually very brief.
The improvisers are forced to invent in order to prolong the scene.
Inventing is forcing new, unnecessary, and potentially complicated
information to a scene in the absence of a game.
For example, if you choose to start a scene as someone buying a cup
of coffee in a deli, you will probably find that you have nowhere else
to take the scene. Think of this same situation in real life. The scene
should be over as soon as the transaction has ended. To prolong these
situations in order to find a scene, new improvisers are often forced
to make something “weird” or “crazy” happen. In other cases, these
scenes devolve into a negotiation over the price of the goods or services
being exchanged, which is uninteresting.
Again, this doesn’t mean that you cannot do scenes where a
transaction is taking place. The key is to avoid making the entire scene
revolve around the transaction, or the What. If you do find yourself
in this situation, there are two ways to avoid a bad scene. First, you
can choose to know the character you are having the interaction with
(maybe you buy coffee in this deli every day, and you know the deli
worker well enough to talk about something else with him). A second
option is to draw on something from your own life. Think of a time
when you were in this situation and you found something interesting
about it. Introduce the specifics of this real-life experience into your
scene. Don’t just invent something crazy; introduce something real
from your own experience.
Ultimately, beginning improvisers will be far better off avoiding
transactions altogether in Organic scenes. Long Form scene work is
about choices. Choosing to start with a simple transaction puts your
scene at risk of being over before anything interesting happens.

The simple answer is yes, but be careful. Remember that these
guidelines exist to help you succeed, especially if you are new to Long
Form. However, there are instances in which successful scenes can
occur in spite of the rules being broken.
Seasoned, experienced, and extremely talented improvisers will
break improv rules all the time. Sometimes, experienced improvisers
will have a reason for breaking a specific rule that will not be readily
apparent to the novice improviser. Don’t take this to mean that you
should also throw the rules out the window. Sometimes, the rules are
being broken for no good reason, but the performers are getting away
with it because they are just funny people.
Watch as much improv as you can when you are starting out. You
will see rules being broken. Notice when this does work and when
it doesn’t work. In both instances, you want to ask yourself, “why?”
There are often explanations for what you may perceive as a rule being
broken. For instance, you may see a scene that starts with a simple
transaction. If this scene is a Premise Scene inspired by a monologue
involving a simple transaction, starting the scene in this way is
completely valid. You will also see plenty of scenes where a character
is asking questions or saying no. Remember, these behaviors are okay
if they are tied to the game of the scene.
Every rule can be broken. If it serves the game of the scene to break
one of the rules, then you should break the rule and serve the game
of the scene. In the meantime, following the rules will give you the
greatest chance at success.
New improvisers will often go through a phase in which, due to
putting a very strong emphasis on the game (fair enough, as the
game is the heart of comedic improv), they neglect other elements of
improvisation, which enhance a game. Most commonly neglected is
top of your intelligence. When you neglect top of your intelligence, a
“game” becomes, in effect, an ungrounded list of unusual things. You
lose the context in which the unusual is funny. What you are doing no
longer resembles real life, and is therefore no longer relatable, and
ultimately less entertaining.
One remedy for this problem is exploring. Explain why things are
unusual. Have logic underpinning and grounding the unusual.
Another remedy is to slow down. Don’t heighten too quickly to
the absurd. Spend time dealing with the game move on hand before
moving on to another.
Another is commitment. Commit to the reality of your scene,
including the reality of your game. Remember a character involved
in the game of the scene finds this pattern of behavior completely

reasonable. You must play the game from the character’s point of view.
Remember, they believe in what they’re doing, so must you.
If you notice that scenes are feeling like a list of unusual things
strung together, don’t make the mistake of blaming this on the game.
The fault lies in not supporting the game with top-of-your-intelligence
play which grounds it, and couches the game elegantly in the world as
we know it.
You may find yourself questioning the merits of game at this point.
It may seem creatively “limiting” when you hear it broken down into
“rules.” Wouldn’t the scene be less predictable and more fun if you
could follow any funny whim you have in the moment, even if it is not
in keeping with the game?
The answer is no. Following your whims in an attempt to go from
individually funny moment to individually funny moment is, for one
thing, very difficult to do. Game gives you a clear structure in which
your comedy can exist. Your ultimate responsibility should be to
give your audience comedy on par with any written work that they
see. The fact that your scene follows a clear pattern (from what you
have established at the start) gives it the same structure as a written
scene. If you start the scene as “Cheap Guy,” the audience will expect
to see you continue to explore this character. A series of random and
unexplained choices will be much less satisfying and much more
confusing. The satisfaction of having pleased the audience with a
focused game will far outweigh the satisfaction of following your
whims in the moment.
It should also be noted that the game is nothing more than a pattern
for you to follow. The choices about what you include in this pattern
are completely and uniquely yours, both in terms of heightening and
exploration. No other improviser will play a game in exactly the same
way that you do. Allow your specific choices and details to make the
game your own.
It is sometimes hard for beginning improvisers to embrace the idea
of serving the game. They feel that it is limiting their own individual
sense of humor. In fact, the opposite is true. If you serve the game,
the game will serve you. Once you have found the game, you will no
longer have to worry about where the scene is going or what action
you have to take next. You can instead focus on coming up with funny
specifics that fit your game. This is where your comic voice can be
heard. Remember, complaining about this would be like a basketball
player complaining that the rules of basketball are limiting. While all
basketball players play by the rules, there is tremendous variation in
their individual styles.

The game also makes it possible for you to work with an ensemble.
Game serves as a common language that all Long Form improvisers
speak. Working with an ensemble will allow you to take your comedy to
places you wouldn’t have been able to take it yourself.
Improvisers who don’t have faith in the game tend to make jokes
for quick laughs. Making jokes that fall outside the pattern of the game
at the expense of the scene undercuts the work you and your scene
partner are trying to do. Making a joke that deviates from the pattern
may give you the instant gratification of an audience’s approval, but if it
goes against the logic of your scene and the pattern of your game, you
may find that you have driven your scene into a brick wall.
If you play the pattern of the game, you will not only get a laugh
in the moment, but you will have the opportunity for more laughs in
the future. Have faith in the game and your ability to bring something
unique and exciting to it.

Longform
Structures
In this section we cover how to structure individual improvised scenes
together in order to create cohesive improvised shows.
A particular structure is called a longform or just a form. A longform
could be: “Okay, we’ll start with one long scene which we’ll call a source
scene, and then we’ll follow that with a series of shorter scenes, each
one of which is exploring something mentioned in the source scene.”
That is a basic description of a longform we call a Deconstruction.
A longform helps scenes work together as a unified set. All longforms
have rules or guidelines which make them work and differentiate them
from other longforms.
We go over several longforms. We focus most on one called the
Harold. The Harold was developed by our teacher Del Close, a director
and improviser from Chicago. He evolved this structure over his whole
career, especially while he was teaching at the iO Theater in Chicago.
The Harold is a simple but ambitious structure that makes rich,
satisfying shows. Although it’s one of the most challenging structures

to perform, we teach the Harold because it forces you to master all the
skills that you need to perform any other longform.
Other forms we’ll go over include: the Movie, the Monoscene, the
Deconstruction, and the Check-In Deconstruction. We give advice for
making your own longforms as well.
We also go over openings. An opening is a pre-defined mini-structure
you use to generate ideas at the top of your show. There are lots of set
openings. Examples: Monologues, Character Monologues, Invocation,
and the Pattern Game. You can also try the organic opening, in which
the team does not set the mini-structure ahead of time.
Finally we go over some of the mechanics of practice and
performance, including how to introduce shows, what makes a good
coach/director, and what makes for a good practice.

SECTION THREE * CHAPTER NINE

Starting from
an Audience
Suggestion

Most longforms begin with a single suggestion
provided by a member of the audience. The
suggestion can be anything: a single word, a
phrase, an object, a text message, a lyric from
a song, a line from a movie—anything. The
suggestion serves as the inspiration for the
entire piece.

The suggestion serves three main functions
within a longform. First, the suggestion proves to
the audience that what they are watching is truly
improvised. Since the suggestion is coming from
the audience, it proves that the show is not pre-
planned. The suggestion also gives you a starting
point for inspiration, as opposed to leaving you to
choose from an infinite number of possibilities.
Finally, the suggestion gives a team a common
focus. Having a common focus will help ensure
that you and your teammates are on the same page
throughout the entire show. A common focus also
allows your group to present a performance that
feels connected by a theme.

No suggestion is a bad suggestion. It is up to the improvisers to
effectively use whatever suggestion they receive as a vehicle for
creating their own ideas, themes, and points of view as a group. At
the same time, the more clearly you can show the audience that

you have arrived at these ideas, themes, and points of view from
their suggestion, the more impressed your audience will likely be.

A longform that is funny and clearly incorporates or deconstructs a
suggestion will be more satisfying to an audience than a show that is
merely funny.



SECTION THREE * CHAPTER TEN

Openings

Some Long Form shows jump
directly from an audience
suggestion into scenes.
However, many longforms
start with some sort of group
process used to generate
information from the
suggestion. This information-
generating process is called
an opening.

An opening serves three

purposes in a longform:

1. It should generate interesting and
funny information to inspire scenes.

2. Itshould strengthen group mind,
specifically getting the group on the
same page regarding their points of
view related to the suggestion.

3. Itshould engage and entertain
the audience.

Topics covered:

¢ The Pattern Game
¢ The Invocation
e« Monologues

e Character Monologues

e Organic Openings



Pulling
Ideas from
the Opening
of an opening, your team should have generated
a lot of useful information to be used for scenes. It is generally a good
idea to use information presented by another player in the opening
when you start a scene. This shows that you have been listening to your
teammates. Using someone’s information helps start your show in the
spirit of collaboration.
There is also a practical reason for initiating with information
provided by someone else. When you start with someone else’s
information, you know for a fact that two members of the group
remember it. Information that you have provided will of course be
memorable to you. However, this information may not have resonated
with anyone else in your group. If you start from your own information,
your scene partner may not know what direction you intend your
scene to go in. If a piece of information that your teammate provided
was strong enough for you to focus on, it probably stood out to other
members of your group as well. The best information is that which
drew everyone’s attention. You are likely to get to the game faster by
starting with this sort of information from an opening.
Information from an opening comes in many different forms:
words, phrases, stories, sounds, movement, etc. As mentioned in
the section on initiating, this information falls into three different
categories: premises, half-ideas, and chaff. The chaff in an opening is
not any more useful for starting scenes than the original suggestion. It
doesn’t have any inherent comedic potential. Premises and half-ideas
are useful for starting scenes because they do have inherent comedic
potential. Premises will be used to initiate Premise scenes, where
both the base reality and the first unusual thing will be established
in a single line. It is as if the opening was the “beginning” or Yes And
portion of the scene, and your premise-based initiation is offering the
first unusual thing. The improvisers in a premise scene are very close

to starting with a fully realized game. Half-ideas can be used to initiate
Organic scenes with information that has comic potential, therefore
making it easier to find a game than if you started with the chaff. Half-
ideas offer something more than a single-word suggestion but less than
a fully formed comedic premise.
Let the audience’s laughter guide you towards premises and half-
ideas in the opening. If they are laughing at information in the opening,
there must be something funny about it.
To reiterate an earlier point, the UCB sees no intrinsic value in one
form of scene over the other !"#$%&’()*+,)-#./’+.0. However, when you
are performing scenes from an opening, you should give priority to
premises over half-ideas. Starting with a premise from an opening
will make getting to game easier and more efficient, and will increase
the likelihood of success. If you can’t identify any premises in your
opening, or if you have run out of premises to use, you can always fall
back on using a half-idea to find your game organically. Since there
is a chance that the premise presented by either you or your scene
partner will not be recognized, you must always be ready to find the
game organically.
Let’s say that these three pieces of information appear in an
opening: shopping, shop-a-holic, and return-a-holic. Shopping would
be an example of chaff. It is no more than a one-word suggestion.
“Shop-a-holic” is a half-idea, since it implies a pathology that most
people do not have. Since it is somewhat unusual, it possesses comedic
potential. “Return-a-holic” is a premise that implies someone whose
only interest in shopping is that it allows the opportunity to return
items. Since this is not something that exists in our reality, it has much
comic potential. You can form an initiation with this information to
establish a first unusual thing that breaks from a base reality.
We do not generate games in the opening. We can only generate
funny premises. The game of the scene will always be more intricate in
the scene than it was as information in the opening. How the game is
played will be determined by how we choose to heighten and explore
after the initial reaction to the premise. A premise becomes a game
based on how you and your scene partner answer the question, “If this
unusual thing is true, then what else is true?”
Improvisers will sometimes change great, funny information
from an opening when they initiate a scene just to be original. Some
people feel that using a fully formed premise is limiting to their own
or their scene partner’s creativity. This is not true. As we have already
mentioned, a game is not really locked until both improvisers respond
to or contribute to a premise. Others will avoid starting with an obvious
premise from the opening because they feel that the audience has
already heard it and that the idea has already been exhausted. You need
to trust that you and your scene partner will be able to find further
exploration of this premise in your scene.

If there is some information that is created in the opening that
suggests, for lack of a better term, an obvious game, use it. There is no
reason to change a premise if it is already funny and clearly suggests
a game. You would never do this if you were writing with someone
else. When two people are writing a comedy movie together and one
person comes up with a funny idea, they use that idea. There is no
need to change ideas to make them your own, because Long Form is
Have no shame about using the funny information from an opening
in your scenes. Remember, one of the main reasons for doing an
opening is to generate funny information. If your team is successful in
doing that, use this information for your scenes. Otherwise, you did a
lot of work for nothing.
A set opening is any opening with a predetermined structure decided
upon by the performers prior to a performance. An improv team can
rehearse the structure of a set opening in preparation for use in shows.
The same structure can be used to generate completely different ideas
for each new performance.
The Pattern Game is a set opening in which a group of improvisers use
word association to generate funny ideas and establish group mind.
The skills you learn to perform a successful Pattern Game can be
brought to bear on all other set openings, and because of this, the
Pattern Game makes a great introduction to set openings in general.
A group that can conquer a successful Pattern Game can do any other
set opening.
These are elements that are required to do a proper Pattern Game.

Here is an example of one loop of a Pattern Game. In a full Pattern
Game, there would be three loops.
Island → Shell Collector → Metal Detector → Lost Watch → Lost
Sunglasses → Lost Passport→ Lost Citizenship → Lost Balance → Pina
Coladas → Coconut Milk → Monkey Milk → Parrot Pee Pee → Toucan
Turds → Turtle Soup → Turtle Salad → Exotic Dishes → Ordering
Incorrectly → Pretentious Orders → “Can you recommend a dish that
is hard to pronounce?” → “I’ll have your most evolved animal, raw.”
→ “I’d like a dozen Galapagos eggs.” → “I’d love anything that uses an
opposable thumb for dessert please.” → Deserted Island → Island
When doing the Pattern Game, the improvisers should stand in a semi-
circle or U-shape. This allows the improvisers to easily maintain eye
contact throughout the opening. Maintaining eye contact will facilitate
the improvisers getting connected and cut down on instances of
speaking over one another.
Confidence and projection are important to the performance of the
Pattern Game. All members of a group should stand up straight and
speak loudly and clearly so that the other members of the group—and
the audience—can hear each new idea.
The Pattern Game uses an advanced form of word association we call
“idea association,” the purpose of which is to lead to the development
of premises or half-ideas. This involves the performers, in no set
order, saying words or phrases inspired by the words and phrases
that have been said previously.
To start, an improviser will say a word or phrase inspired by the
suggestion. This will inspire the next word or phrase. From this point
on, each new term is in response to the previous terms.
Idea association isn’t just knee jerk, spontaneous word association,
such as saying “jelly” in response to “peanut butter.” Simple word
association like that tends to generate lateral information. Instead,
idea association is making richer, more thoughtful responses to
words, like saying “allergy” in response to “peanut butter.” This moves
us forward, on to something with more possibilities.
To make responses richer and more thoughtful, personalize your
responses, sharing something you find interesting, specific, or funny
about what has come before.
Let’s imagine one of your teammates just said “dog.” Simple word
association may only result in the response of “cat” or “pet.” However,
if you idea associate off of “dog,” you will give more thoughtful
responses such as “loyal,” “rescue,” or “man’s best friend.”

We don’t need to list a bunch of colors, we all know what colors are.
Rainbow to colors is a pretty obvious connection. So obvious that we
don’t gain any new information. The Pattern Game should help us
explore the suggestions more deeply with a point of view, not just list
shallow, obvious responses to it. A good tip is to avoid lists or subsets in
your Pattern Game.
In this example the responses put the suggestion in a broader, more
interesting context. By saying “leprechaun” after “rainbow” we
moved forward into the realm of fantasy. Here are some other idea
associations off of “rainbow” that would have moved us forward in
different ways: rainbow to prisms, rainbow to LGBTQ flags, or rainbow
Once you have idea associated off of the suggestion, everyone in your
group should be looking to develop premises.
This begins by someone sharing a funny idea inspired by the idea
association up to that point. That is the beginning of a process called
riffing, in which you make “If Then” game moves. The first riff frames
a comedic idea from the previous terms. Then the group builds off that
riff—essentially making game moves off of it.
Moving from idea association to riffing in your Pattern Game is
equivalent to switching over from “Yes And” to “If Then” in a scene.
Here is an example of a Pattern Game taken from an actual
UCB workshop:

The person who said “making your own clothes” was riffing off of
the previous few terms “shopping with Mom,” “embarrassment,” and
“no brand names.” Together, they presented the idea of a child being
embarrassed by not having brand name products. So the improviser
used “If Then” to come up with the phrase “making your own clothes.”
Note how important group mind is here. The idea came from
synthesizing several people’s contributions.
At this point in the Pattern Game, the rest of the team laughed.
Laughter is often a clue that you have started riffing. The group then
continued riffing as shown below.
By making these two additional moves, the group solidified what they
found to be funny about “making your own clothes” and created the
premise of a child who makes all their own back to school supplies.
Another way to find premises using cues from within the group is
to create funny ideas by noticing interesting juxtapositions of words or
phrases in the Pattern Game, and synthesizing them to create funny
ideas. Let’s look at an example of a group building a premise in this way:
Via idea association, this group started to create a clear theme of
spiritual, Zen ideas off of their suggestion. The improviser who said
“buffet” heard “whales” and thought of the huge amount of food a whale
eats. To this improviser, “buffet” related to whales, but it also introduced
a new, mundane idea that stood out from the pattern of spiritual ideas.
The next improviser said “sounds of eating buffet” because they found
the juxtaposition of a buffet, after all the soothing ideas that preceded
it, to have comedic potential. This idea of unappealing sounds, like
strangers eating at a buffet being soothing and spiritual, is the start of a
riff. They might continue riffing with the following terms:

There’s a fine distinction between synthesizing ideas in a way that’s
earned and a way that’s forced. Earned ideas grow organically from
the idea being explored through group mind in the Pattern Game !’,.,4)
+9’#’?8%5’?60, while forced ideas are unrelated to what the group mind is
currently exploring. Organic connections will inspire strong premises
and half-ideas. Random connections will inspire less fruitful ideas.
A common type of forced idea is someone cramming two words
together arbitrarily, like in this next example.
The improviser who said “bonsai buffet” did not build off of the bigger
theme of spirituality created by the group. A move like this betrays the
momentum of the group mind, and is therefore not supportive of your
Funny ideas should arise organically, through the group mind, and
not be created independently by individuals in the group. A good clue
that the group is not finding their premises together is when premises
are introduced too quickly in the Pattern Game. That usually indicates
that one improviser has done all the work themself to come up with a
premise, rather than using the group mind.
What if the above horticulture example had a premise show up in
the fourth term?
There are two problems with the above example. One, the premise
comes out of nowhere, feeling forced and unearned to the audience and
the other improvisers. Two, since it happened so quickly, there’s not
as many shared details as there would be if the group had contributed
more terms.
Imagine that the premise came after a few more details:
Horticulture, bonsai, meditation, yoga class, chimes, Zen gardens, leaf
blower in a Zen garden

The extra shared details make the context in which the leaf blower is
funny clearer to the entire group.
After you develop a premise (or more, as explained below) you will
idea associate back to the suggestion that you used to begin. We call
returning to the suggestion completing a loop. In order to do this, you
must keep the suggestion in the back of your mind during the entire
Pattern Game.
Here are a couple of examples of full loops in a Pattern Game:
Ideally, a loop should be between thirteen and twenty moves. This
assumes a loop in which one premise has been explored. Sometimes
the group will choose to explore another premise or two if they are not
enthusiastic about the first one they have found. In this case the loop
would of course contain more moves. When you have found at least one
premise you are satisfied with, you will return to the suggestion.
Once you have returned to the suggestion, you will begin a second
loop by again moving away from the suggestion via idea association.
The Pattern Game is complete once you have returned to the suggestion
three times. By doing this, you will have created three loops of unique
information, all inspired by the same suggestion.
Each loop of information should have one or two premises or half-
ideas that were riffed on, providing three to six premises to be used
for initiations.

You can think of
the structure of a
completed Pattern
Game as a three-leaf
clover. Each of the
three completed loops
of information is a leaf
in the clover.
Returning to
the suggestion is
important. It lets the
audience know that
you are generating
ideas that truly use
and explore the
original suggestion.
Now that we have discussed the rules to do a basic Pattern Game, let’s
discuss some guidelines. These aren’t absolutely required to perform
a Pattern Game, but by following them, you will make your Pattern
Games funnier, faster, and easier.
Don’t just say each word or phrase in a neutral way, instead “perform”
each word or phrase. Doing so will make the information you are
getting across clearer by attaching your point of view to what you
are saying.

Also, by performing each word in your Pattern Game, you will make
it more entertaining for the audience. The opening is the first time that
the audience is seeing your group. If you start out the show timidly or
awkwardly, it will be more difficult to get the audience on your side
and ready to laugh. Sell the audience on the ideas and premises in your
Pattern Game.
Allow opinions or emotions to show through in the way you speak.
For example if your suggestion is “fork,” and it leads you to think of a
specific cafeteria lady whom you encountered as a kid in school and
did not like, you shouldn’t just say “cafeteria lady” in a flat, emotionless
way. Instead you might say “cafeteria lady” with disdain or disgust.

Whenever you infuse a word with opinion or feeling, you are also
offering up a richer idea off of which your teammates can build.
Deliver words “in character” in order to present them in a specific
context. For instance you could say “horse” in a cowboy voice, or with
an upper-class English accent. These create two entirely different
contexts for the word. The former puts “horse” in the context of the
gritty, unrefined west, the latter puts “horse” in the context of the
privileged rich.
Each new word or phrase should build upon the performance style
of the last thing said. Don’t take a step backward by returning to a
neutral delivery. This is not to say that you must adhere slavishly to one
performance style once introduced, just that you shouldn’t completely
abandon the performance aspect of delivering information and return
to a neutral delivery.
The main goal of riffing is to build premises. To help ensure that
you get the best premise out of an idea you will use a concept called
making threes.
Making threes is when you make at least three “If Then” moves off
some interesting or unusual information. When someone begins to “If
Then,” they are signaling to the rest of the group that there is something
worth exploring. Having at least two more moves ensures that you and
your group are seeing the same premise or half-idea. While three is the
minimum, do as many riffs on a premise as you need to make it clear.
When initiating, use whichever “If Then” move you feel is strongest to
introduce the premise you discovered in the Pattern Game.
This example is from a workshop. The group started with the
suggestion “dissent,” then idea associated to tyranny, and then got
more specific regarding tyranny with “corporate overlords.” From
there, they idea associated “company wars” with the specific example,
“Microsoft vs Apple.” Microsoft vs Apple was said with a specific energy
like an emcee announcing the next wrestling bout. That got a laugh
and inspired the next move “Two CEOs duking it out.” They arrived at

a funny idea inspired by corporate rivalries. They then made threes by
adding “strong billionaires” and “a jacked Steve Jobs.”

They now had a clear premise for a scene—the idea of CEOs using
physical fights in corporate competition.

Let’s look at another example of making threes:

EXAMPLE 7

SUGGESTION: NASCAR

NASCAR, Tide, sponsor, AA meetings, cold coffee, phone calls, menthols,
patches, Patch Adams, Patch Jackson (said in an “action movie” voice), sad
action heroes, good cop/tearjerker cop, Freeze or I’ll cry...

This example was also from a workshop. Thanks to the use of
performance, “Patch Jackson” was a very clear idea and it received a
laugh. This was the team’s cue to make threes (in fact, more than three):
Patch Jackson, sad action heroes, good cop/tearjerker cop, Freeze or I’ll cry...



Lists or subsets don’t actually generate new information but just restate
what has already been said. Remember our examples before off the
suggestion “rainbow”:
Rhyming isn’t really performing an idea association, so it will make
it harder to find earned, truthful premises. Here is an example of the
difference between rhyming off a suggestion and idea associating off of
a suggestion:
When idea associating, you want to avoid using overly personal proper
nouns !.,$,4)X&(5.);.74)?:.)&%/.)2>)?:.)+?#..?)628)$#.3)89)2&4)?:.)&%/.)2>)
628#)(:’57:227)1%16+’??.#4).?(,0. It will be impossible for your teammates
to decode the connection you’ve made and add on appropriately,
because they will have no knowledge about what you’ve added to the
Pattern Game. Proper nouns with which everyone is familiar are fine to
use !.,$,4)<%+:’&$?2&4)K,G,4)2#)@(K2&%57I+0.
Sometimes when riffing you might find yourself using dialogue. This is
fine, but not if you respond to it with more dialogue. For example in the
Pattern Game off of “island” at the beginning of this section, someone
said, “I’ll have your most evolved animal, raw.” You wouldn’t want to
respond to this with another line of dialogue, such as, “Unfortunately,
most of the most evolved animals are on the protected species list.”
Doing this would essentially start a scene in the middle of the Pattern
Game. This would slow the Pattern Game down, make it too wordy, and
spend too much time on one idea.

5. DON’T JUST JAM RANDOM WORDS TOGETHER
TO FIND PREMISES

Jamming words together often dismisses a train of thought the
Pattern Game was on, and instead forces a new arbitrary idea. Off the
suggestion “horticulture”

BAD: horticulture, bonsai, Zen garden, the sounds of whales, buffet,
bonsai buffet...

GOOD: horticulture, bonsai, Zen garden, the sounds of whales, buffet, the
sounds of eating buffet...

LENGTH

A reasonable length for an efficient and productive Pattern Game is
four to five minutes.

While the opening is important, recognize that the scene work
which follows your opening is going to be the most enjoyable part of
your show. Only spend as much time on the Pattern Game as you need
to generate scene ideas.

As we said above, each loop should be between thirteen and twenty
moves if you explore one premise/half-idea, or somewhat more if you
explore two.

If a loop is ten words or less, you likely got to a premise/half-idea
too soon, with one person forcing a premise early. If you go longer
than twenty, then the Pattern Game got too long, making it hard to
remember the premises and half-ideas you developed.

PATTERN GAME CHALLENGE

O ne way to approach developing premises in the Pattern Game is to
put this challenge before your group: Imagine that you were told
that you’d be paid a million dollars for three comedy sketches, but you
only had one Pattern Game to generate the ideas for these sketches.
Broad, generic, or obvious words aren’t going to help you find these
sketch ideas. In order to be able to come up with these sketch ideas
this successfully, you would need to be as specific as possible.

Let’s look at both general and specific versions of the same
idea. Which of the following suggests a more specific idea fora
sketch: “green energy” or “wind power?” How about “recession” or
“homemade notebook?” Which sounds funnier: “patriotism” or “red,
white, and blue suit?” The more specific you can be, the more likely
you are to quickly find solid premises for your scenes.

As you can see this Pattern Game follows the three rules we set out
at the start of this section: They start with the suggestion LK382CE3AAM$
and then idea associate off of that suggestion)!15%(A)?.B?0, then they
discover terms with comedic potential and riff off of them to form
premises !#.7)?.B?0, and they return to the suggestion three times.
The group used performance well. Some words/terms were
delivered with an energy that played into the idea. The horror poems
were delivered with a scary voice, the “You say tomato, I say tomato”
was delivered to the tune of “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off.”
And each loop created one or two premises.
This wasn’t a perfect Pattern Game. They rarely are. The first loop
doesn’t have any riffs that “made threes.” And there are a lot of pop
culture references !K’E(85?)-.295.4)O#&’.)>#2/)H.+%/.)H?#..?4)H%34)-5%&.?)

This is a pretty clear initiation off of the idea of horror poems.

and putting it in the base reality of a doctor’s visit.

CHAPTER TEN * Openings

Exercise: Practicing the
Pattern Game

In this exercise, a group does a quick series of partial Pattern Games,
adding a new component each time, until the group finally does a full
Pattern Game.

The components of the Pattern Game are added in this order:
Idea association

Looping back to the suggestion

Creating three loops of information from one suggestion
Riffing on an idea

Saying ideas with energy

Riffing on an idea, but now also making threes

This exercise is also a good warm-up to do before a show.

A group of improvisers stands in a horseshoe ora circle.

Get a suggestion, and do a portion of a quick Pattern Game,
incorporating only the first component “idea association.” Proceed for
fifteen to twenty words or phrases.

Get another suggestion, and now incorporate the first two components:
idea association and looping back to the suggestion.

Continue in this manner, adding new components until you have
incorporated all six components.

The last iteration will be a complete Pattern Game.


It makes the rules and guidelines of the Pattern Game more
manageable by introducing them one at a time, causing you to focus
on each new component as it is added.

The Pattern Game includes all of the elements found in any other
opening. Thus practicing it will make you better at openings in general.

It develops your ability to create group mind in an ensemble, which
will serve you well in any improv performance.

It helps you get better at creating, recognizing, and continuing
patterns, which are at the heart of all comedy.

It strengthens your listening skills.



The
Invocation
is a set opening developed by Del Close.
The suggestion for an Invocation is always an object. Instead of just
generating ideas inspired by the suggestion, a team performing this
opening explores the suggestion by using their words to “summon” the
suggested object via a specifically structured incantation.
In the first section of the Invocation, the object is treated as a “thing.”
The group states facts or truths about the suggestion. Make these facts
or truths as specific as possible. These ideas should be stated in phrases
all starting with the words “It is.” It is important that these facts and
truths are not just physical descriptions of the suggestion. Use !"#$%
$&&’(!$)!’*, as described in the Pattern Game section, to come up with
more interesting observations here.

The “it is” section will continue with the improvisers generating even
more information about the suggestion of cell phone. In the above
example, some of the moves are descriptive, factual truths about cell
phones. Some are true statements about cell phones that also suggest
specific characters or situations. For instance, “It is what brings me
bad news via voicemails” suggests a character that is pessimistic about
everything. The move “It is going off in the movie theater right now”
suggests a situation in which cell phone use is annoying. At this point in
the opening, we have only planted the seeds of possible characters and
premises. We will expand upon these ideas in the following sections.
Once you have generated somewhere from thirteen to twenty “it is”
statements about the suggestion, you will move onto the next section,
in which each new statement will begin with the words “You Are.”%
)/’%’.%)-.##%!"#$&9: In the “You Are” section of the Invocation, the object
is treated like a person. In the “You Are” section, you move beyond the
factual to the analytical. You will do this by “talking to” the suggested
object, attributing a personal nature or human characteristics to the
suggestion. You can either return to ideas from “It is” or create brand
new ones.
The improvisers have returned to ideas from the “It Is” section and
expanded upon them. When you move onto the “You Are” section, you
do not need to return to every idea in the order that they were originally

said. You also don’t need to return to every single idea. The ideas that
stood out the most will be the ones to resurface in later rounds. The
move “You are what I will scream into until my client gets a big enough
dressing room!” is expanding upon the agent character implied by the
“It Is” move “It is the tool I use to make deals for my clients.”
You want to add onto someone else’s idea in this round, as opposed
to returning to your own. This ensures that you are listening, and it
helps you to develop group ownership over the ideas generated. As is
the case with the Pattern Game, focusing in on someone else’s idea
will help ensure that more people in your group are aware of what is
funny about this idea. (There will now be at least two people aware
of the idea you have expanded upon.) This will increase the chances
of both improvisers being on the same page when a scene is initiated
using this idea.
After another 13 to 20 statements in the “You Are” round, you will
move onto the next section, “Thou Art.” In the “Thou Art” section of
the Invocation, the object is treated like a god. Each statement in this
section will begin with the words “Thou art.” You will return to ideas
from the previous two sections, abstracting or distilling them for
use in the scenes of the show. To help endow the object with godlike
status, you want to deliver each statement with commitment and in a
heightened way of speaking. Deliver your “Thou Art” statements like
a Shakespearean actor performing on Broadway, trying to reach those
audience members sitting in the back of the house. You are now dealing
with the suggestion on a “grand” level. It should almost feel as though
the team is collectively worshiping the suggestion.
New ideas and perspectives on the suggestion are also welcome in
this section of the Invocation.

In this section, each point of view is specified and exaggerated so
that it is memorable to all members of the group. Again, it is best to
make “Thou Art” statements that expand on other people’s ideas from
the previous sections of the Invocation. This will let your teammates
know what ideas you find interesting while also allowing you to add
something of your own to an idea.
Again, new ideas are welcome in “Thou Art,” and it isn’t necessary to
come back to every single idea. You also don’t have to return to ideas in
the order in which they were originally presented.
After another 13 to 20 statements in the “Thou Art” round, you will
move onto the next section, “I am.” In the “I am” section of the
invocation, you “become” the object. The invocation ends with the
group summarizing the strongest ideas. Each member of the group will
sum up one of the idea threads that have been expanded upon in the
Invocation (e.g. the character of the agent, “inappropriate situations to
use cell phones,” etc.). This is done using a single word, preceded by the
words “I am.” While you should aim for one, saying two or three words
is acceptable. These “I am” statements should also be delivered with a
sense of finality.
Each member of the group should speak only once in this section
of the opening. No new ideas should be incorporated. Look at this
section of the opening as your chance to create an easy-to-remember
list of your strongest ideas. Don’t go back to obvious or surface-level
descriptions of the object in this section. Try, in a single word, to
pinpoint the unique perspectives your group developed about the
Once every member of the team has spoken, bring the opening to a
close by saying, “I…AM...[the suggestion]!” in unison.

Now all of the words in this “I Am” section have a clear connection to
“cell phone,” even though on a surface level, words like “rule-breaker”
or “disappointment” may not be the first things that come into your
mind when you think “cell phone.”
The Invocation opening, like the Pattern Game, will present both
premises and half-ideas with which to start scenes.
For instance, the idea thread about the agent suggests a specific
character or point of view that can be brought into a scene. Starting a
scene with the agent character would be starting with a half-idea. The
game of this scene will be found through listening and making strong
Yes And moves. On the other hand, the “interruption” idea thread
suggests a premise that an improviser could initiate a scene with.
Let’s look at examples of each type of initiation from this Invocation.

INVOCATION OF DEL CLOSE

he following is an example of Del Close performing an Invocation

of himself, by himself, for his students. Note that because Del is
using himself instead of an object, his first section becomes “He is/
was” instead of “It is.”

Invocation of Del Close

He was a young comedian.

He didn’t know what he was doing and got into show
business for all the wrong reasons: ego satisfaction,
the fact that is was too easy, very easy, very easy to
impress, very easy to generate a little easy charisma.
But then he began to learn.

You! You! You asshole, you began to learn.

You stayed in your work too long, until it

was too late, and then you began to realize

what you had gotten yourself into.

You surprised him!

You took a step he didn’t expect, and you committed
to something that frightened him to death.

Thou art my higher nature, and I have become thee.
Much to my surprise.

I know who thou art.

Thou comest and takest my body and my mind and use
it for thy purpose with my wholehearted permission.

I am the messenger.

I am not what he expected to become.

There is no enlightenment or reward in this life for me.

I am the messenger.

I am the channel.

I am his final doom.

I am the door through which you
will pass, but he may not.

But he understands.

I am the messenger.

Nothing less.

But nothing more.



The specific structure of the Invocation makes it appealing to newer
improvisers. The structure guarantees that everyone on your team will
know both what to do next and when the opening will be finished. The
structure’s theatricality also generally makes this opening engaging,
satisfying, and entertaining to audiences.
The Invocation also allows a group of improvisers to work together
to gather different perspectives on a single suggestion. It generates
information for scene work while entertaining the audience. It also
emphasizes listening and building on each other’s ideas, behaviors
essential to the success of any longform.
The Invocation is a good opening for beginning improvisers. The
Invocation offers new improvisers a structured way to honor and
explore the suggestion given to them by the audience. Whenever you
are performing a longform, you should try to imagine a question mark
after your suggestion. If you are really honoring the suggestion, the
Long Form show you perform should answer this implied question
posed to you by the audience. The structure of the Invocation, which
forces you to return specific ideas connected to the suggestion, will
help you to do this.
Monologues
monologue openings briefly in the
section on finding game with premise. We will now take a more in-
depth look at how to perform this opening.
The Monologue Opening is a set opening that is usually performed
by a single person. The monologist can be member of the ensemble or
a guest performer. The monologist will tell a true story that has been
inspired by an audience suggestion. The rest of the ensemble will pay
close attention to the monologue, listening for premises and half-ideas
to inspire their scene work.
Any true anecdote or story that a suggestion conjures up in your
mind is good enough to be a monologue. The very fact that you have
remembered this story means that something happens during it that
is a break from the commonplace. This break from the expected, the
element that makes this story “a story,” is what the improvisers in your
group will use as premises for their scenes.

Note that your anecdote or story must be true. There are a few
reasons for this. First and foremost, fabricating an interesting story
that is not true is going to be very difficult for you to do as a monologist.
Secondly, an overly absurd fictional story is going to be filled with ideas
that have already been exaggerated and heightened, leaving nowhere
for the improvisers to go in scenes.
Specifics and details are extremely valuable to the improvisers
listening to your monologue. Sometimes a detail will inspire an entirely
different premise. In other instances, a detail will provide a half-idea
that can be used to initiate an Organic scene. Specifics and details can
help inspire strong characters or locations for two improvisers to start
a scene.
The monologue doesn’t need to be a piece of stand up comedy.
It doesn’t need to be “hilarious” on its own. All an improviser needs
from a monologue is a true story filled with specifics and details. The
monologue is not the time to tell jokes. Like any other opening, the
monologue must generate information for scenes. The scenes are what
we want to focus on making funny.
As with any opening, listening is the key to success with monologues.
The rest of the ensemble must be listening intently to both the
monologue and the audience’s reactions to this monologue. The
improvisers should be asking themselves things like “Where did the
audience laugh?” “Why did they laugh at that detail or moment?” and
“What is funny about this story?”
Improvisers need to go beyond identifying the funny specifics and
details present in this story. You want to attempt to isolate potential
premises by asking yourself, “What is funny about this monologue
on a conceptual level?” Sum up the essence of the story’s humor
without using any specifics. Boiling down a monologue to what is
fundamentally funny about it will help you find premises.
These premises can then be easily inserted into different
situations with different specifics.
Another source of premises in a monologue are the funny
behaviors and points of views of the people described in the
monologue. These behaviors and points of view can be embodied and
exaggerated for characters in your scenes.
You may also find inspiration for a character based on how the
monologist tells a story. In these instances, you are drawing on the
real-time behavior, mannerisms, and opinions of your monologist.
For example, if a monologist referred to something very tragic as a
“bummer,” you might initiate a scene as a character that is cavalier
about tragedy.

You must also pay attention to specifics and details in monologues.
Although they may not provide fully formed premises for scenes, they
are often interesting or unusual enough to provide half-ideas to start
scenes with.
You want to avoid simply reenacting the story from the monologue
that was told with all of the same specifics. The audience has already
heard this story. We don’t want to give them what they already know. In
fact, you never want to use more than one premise or half-idea from
the monologue per scene that you perform. There are two reasons for
this. First, if you use multiple scene ideas in one scene, you will burn
through your stock of ideas too quickly. Remember that the entire
ensemble is depending on using information from the monologue to
inspire scenes. Additionally, including more than one premise or half-
idea in the same scene will muddy the game of your scene. Including
more than one premise or half-idea in the same scene will weaken the
base reality, and it will steer you towards crazy town.
There are three ways to start a scene using a premise from a
monologue. The first way is called nail on the head, in which you use
an event or line from a monologue almost exactly as it was presented
in the monologue. The event or line you take should be funny or have
inherent comic potential. In a nail on the head scene, you will want to
heighten from this starting point. The second way is called one step
beyond, in which you start with the same specifics (the Who, What,
and Where) from the monologue, but not an exact line or event. “One
step beyond” refers to the fact that you are starting with something that
is heightened, or one step beyond what happened in the monologue.
In these scenes, you can avoid reenactment by exaggerating the
circumstances or character behavior. The third way is to perform
an analogous scene, in which you change the specifics from the
monologue but retain the fundamental premise.
Below are examples of nail on the head, one step beyond, and
analogous scene initiations, all based on the same premise pulled from
an actual monologue, told by Andy Richter at the Upright Citizens
Brigade Theatre:

CHAPTER TEN * Openings

But football was the one, because of my size and just
because of the whiteness of where | was from, football

was the thing and you’ve got to play football. And |

played football up until my junior year. | never really had
the killer instinct and | would see this Lord of the Flies
transformation of all my friends. There was this one kid
who was just an asshole. It was when we were sophomores
and we were scrimmaging the freshman, and he took out a
freshman’s knee, gave him a compound fracture, and then
high-fived everybody because there was a bone sticking
out of the kid’s leg. And that’s where I’d kind of stand there
just feeling like, ‘I’m in the wrong place.”

Nail on the Head

EXAMPLE 1: “Now that’s a tackle! You broke that kid’s arm!
Way to go!”

EXAMPLE 2: “Listen up, team. We’re gonna work all
summer. Five days a week. Weight training
and wind sprints. However, | am obliged
to tell you these practices are ‘voluntary,’
And | think you all know what voluntary
means.” (laughs)

EXAMPLE 3: “Listen to me kid, don’t get into the
grocery business.”

All of these lines are funny or have inherent comic potential. As the
scene progresses, do not follow the story of the monologue. Instead,
create a pattern of behavior from the event or line of dialogue that you
started the scene with in order to find a game. For instance, in Example
1, we could create a pattern of behavior if the player says, “Coach, I’m
on fire today. I feel like I could break a leg or even a spine.” This creates
the game of “football team celebrating violence.”

In Example 2, you could create a pattern of behavior if the coach
goes on to say, “I don’t want you going to see movies this summer,
I want you watching last season’s game films. But that is just a
‘suggestion.” This line sets up the game of “mandatory, extreme
personal sacrifice being disingenuously presented as voluntary.”

Example 3 could progress with the following line: “At the beginning,
when you do a cleanup in an aisle, you think you’re making a difference.



You feel like a hero. But then you realize there’s no parade and there’s
another spill two aisles over.” This initiation has been built upon to
create the game of “a grocery store clerk talking about his job like a
grizzled war veteran.”
Let’s say a monologue includes the following sentence: “They’d be
talking about, you know, competing grocery stores, how that one has
a shitty meat department and, you know, all this stuff…” You might
initiate by saying, “Yo man, you’re one of the new guys. We’re going
over to Whole Foods right now. You have a chain or bat or something?”
This would establish the premise of “gang-like rivalries between
supermarket chains.”
Let’s say a monologue includes this following structure instead:
“At practice, when we were sophomores scrimmaging against the
freshman, one of the guys kind of chop-blocked one of the freshman
and gave him a compound fracture, and then got up and high fived the
other guys about, like, breaking a kid’s leg so the bone as sticking out.
Whoo! Yeah! We did it! We fucking injured a fourteen-year-old…” You
might then initiate by saying, “Listen up guys, this is Henderson. He’s
our fourteen-year-old to hurt today. I’d like to see a broken leg out of
him by the end of practice.” This establishes the premise of “treating
the injury of younger students as a regular part of practice.”
Off of this section of the monologue: “Hey coach, I just wanted to
say I do know what voluntary means…thanks a lot for letting us blow
off practices this summer.” This establishes the premise of “missing the
subtext of what someone is saying and taking them literally.”

It is easier to identify and use what is funny in a monologue than it is
for other openings. First, the point of telling a monologue is to clearly
present something you found to be unusual or funny to an audience.
Additionally, listening to funny stories and understanding what is
funny about them is something that everyone has done their entire
lives. It isn’t a skill you have to learn, such as generating and identifying
funny ideas in more abstract openings like the Pattern game or the
Invocation. Due to this greater ease in recognizing premises in a
monologue, it is more likely that you and your fellow performers will be
on the same page.
By pulling the funny premises from a monologue and using them to
start scenes, you avoid the work of establishing a base reality and first
unusual thing. Remember, a premise presents a base reality and first
unusual thing simultaneously. Starting with a premise will allow you
and your scene partner to find your game much faster than if starting
from scratch.
Audiences enjoy monologues because it is easy for them to see their
suggestion at work. If the monologist has done their job, the connection
between the suggestion and the monologue should be very clear. Since

it is easy to identify and pull premises from a monologue, the audience
should, in turn, see their suggestion reflected in the scene work.
The major drawback of using monologues is that they aren’t
as group mind-oriented as other set openings. Instead of working
together to generate ideas for scenes, all of the information is coming
from one person. Additionally, if you are acting as the monologist
for your ensemble, it can be difficult to pull ideas from your own
monologue, thereby making it difficult for you to initiate scenes. While
monologue openings are easier for a group just starting to perform,
they are not the best opening for developing a group mind.
Character monologues are used in a set opening in which improvisers
take turns creating characters in the moment. Each improviser
delivers a completely fictional monologue in character out to the
audience. All of the characters are inspired by the same single
suggestion from the audience. The improvisers will then use the
premises and half-ideas from these character monologues to initiate
the scenes of the longform.
When you portray a character in this opening, you must make it
specific. For instance, if the suggestion of “heart transplant” made
you think of a doctor, you can’t just portray a “typical” doctor; you
have to play a specific type of doctor. Your first impulse should be to
think of a real doctor that you know whom you find to be interesting.
For instance, if you knew a doctor who smoked and cursed while
he examined you, you could use this, creating a character by
extrapolating behaviors consistent with smoking and cursing. Doing
this will ultimately create a premise you can use to initiate a scene.
If the connection you make to the suggestion brings to mind
an archetypal character as opposed to a real person, you can use
this character archetype to create a completely fictional, specific
character. A simple way to accomplish this is to put an adjective in
front of the character archetype you are playing. This adjective should
be inspired by your opinion of or knowledge of this archetype. You
will extrapolate behaviors for this character based on the adjective
you have selected. Once again, if the connection you make to the
suggestion is the archetype of “doctor” and not a specific doctor
from your life experiences, begin by thinking of your opinions of or
general knowledge about doctors. If the first thing you think of is that
doctors make a lot of money, you might choose to add the adjectives
“heartless” and “greedy” to doctor and then perform a monologue as
this character.

Remember, one of the main purposes of an opening is to generate
many different premises and half-ideas for scenes from a single
suggestion. In order to do this, you’ll want to have variety in the
characters you create as an ensemble. For example, the suggestion of
“guitar” could inspire individual members of an ensemble to perform
character monologues as an arrogant rock star, a depressed music
teacher, an overly aggressive street musician, a pretentious college
radio DJ, an evangelical Christian who thinks rock music is evil, a self-
important open mic organizer, and a mother who is tormented by her
son’s loud music. You wouldn’t want to take the suggestion of “guitar”
and perform monologues as eight different arrogant rock stars.
Each monologue is performed until another member of the
ensemble edits it. You edit someone by stepping forward to deliver
your own monologue. Once everyone has established a character,
the ensemble will begin revisiting the characters they’ve already
created. By returning to these character monologues, the ensemble
has a chance to get more specific with the ideas and points of view
they’ve created. Since these character monologues will be revisited
two to three times over the course of the opening, each monologue
should be short and therefore edited aggressively. When revisiting
your character, try to incorporate themes and details from the
other character monologues into your own. Do not try to establish
relationships between the different characters. Remember, we aren’t
creating a story with this opening; we are creating information to
inspire scenes. Characters don’t need to be revisited in the same order.
Any member of the ensemble can end the opening with a sweep edit.
This will generally happen on a laugh line, when the ensemble feels
that enough information has been generated to inspire their scenes.

Example

Let’s look at an example:
SUGGESTION: FIRE

PLAYER 1/ LOTHARIO FIREMAN:

PLAYER 2/ CAVEMAN:

PLAYER 3/ MIDDLE AGED WOMAN:

PLAYER 4/MOOCHER:

PLAYER 5/ INTENSE SCOUT MASTER:


“| became a fireman
because you get a lot of
tail. Women are really
turned on by life-saving.”

“Fire is passing fad.
Caveman no believe fire
good for human race in
long run.”

“This is so depressing.
Did we really have to
emphasize how old | am
by putting forty-eight
individual candles on
the cake?”

“Hey man, can!l buma
smoke from you? Come
on man, I’ll buy you a
pack, | swear.”

“Don’t sign up to be an
Eagle Scout unless you’re
serious about scouting,
okay? Eagle scouts aren’t
just eagle scouts on the
weekend. You’ve got to be
scouting 24/7.”


In these five monologues, we have five very different takes on the
suggestion that could inspire a number of different scenes. In an
actual, full character monologue opening, we would hear a few more
characters (depending on the number of people in the ensemble) and
then we’d return to each character.
As you stand on the back-line, it is important for you to listen carefully
to the character monologue being performed. Listening carefully
will help you to incorporate themes and details from other character
monologues into your own. Listening also makes you better prepared to
explore any premise or half-idea presented to you in a scene initiation.
As with any opening, you have the option of taking either a premise
or a half-idea inspired by something that one of the characters said to
initiate a scene.
Once again, there are three ways to initiate a scene using a premise
from a monologue. You can initiate a nail on the head scene, in which
you play the character you created, using an exact line of dialogue
from your monologue. You will then continue to develop the character
off of this first line. In a one-step-beyond initiation from a character
monologue opening, you play the character you created but do not
initiate with an exact line from your monologue. You begin with a line
that is heightened one step beyond what happened in the monologue.
It is also possible for you to initiate a one step beyond scene by offering
an initiation that sets up one of your teammates to play the character
that they created in the opening. The final possibility would be to
initiate with a premise that is analogous to the central premise from
a character monologue. In this case, you are not limited to using your
own character monologue. You can pull a premise from any character
monologue in the opening.
Character monologues are a great way to force your ensemble to make
strong character choices. Also, like regular monologues, they are
often more immediately satisfying and entertaining for an audience
unaccustomed to Long Form.
The one drawback of the Character Monologue opening is that,
since it is less dependent on the group mind, it puts more of a burden
on each individual to generate funny ideas by themselves.

EXERCISE: ADJECTIVE,
ADJECTIVE, NAME

INSTRUCTIONS
A group of improvisers create a back-line.

One improviser steps off of the back-line to be the character

On the back-line, assign two improvisers to provide
adjectives, and one improviser to provide a name.

On the count of three, the assigned improvisers on the
back-line yell out the adjectives and name.

The character monologist immediately takes on these
adjectives and introduces themselves in character.

EXAMPLE: 1...2...3! “Smelly!” “Creepy!” “Carl!”

SMELLY CREEPY CARL: (sniff) “Hi girls. I’m Carl. Sorry
about the smell. That’s why!
came into the ladies room...”

After they have performed a one-minute monologue as this
character, start over with a new volunteer from the back-line.

PURPOSE

This exercise allows you to practice performing character
monologues without the burden of coming up with

characteristics yourself.

FINAL WORD ON SET OPENINGS

The set openings described here are only a small sampling of the
many set openings in existence. Ensembles around the country are
constantly creating new set openings. Now that you have a sense of a
set opening’s purpose and the structure of some of the most important
ones, you and your group can create a set opening of your own design.
Any agreed upon structure that generates ideas, develops group mind,
and entertains the audience will work as a set opening. The most
important thing that an opening must do is generate ideas. No matter



what kind of opening you create, make sure that it first and foremost
provides ideas for scenes.
As a beginning improviser, be careful that your group doesn’t spend
too much time creating a novel, signature opening. Your primary focus
should be on making your scene work well.
The Organic Opening (also known as “the Organic”) is an
unstructured opening that can include elements of other set openings
without adhering to the overall form of these openings. The form of
the Organic is discovered in the process of performing it. In addition
to elements of set openings, the Organic often will include simple
sounds and movements as a means of creating information. (Please
see the exercise “Follow the Follower” for an explanation of sound
and movement.)
The Organic Opening starts with an audience suggestion and goes
wherever the group performing it wants it to go. In a true Organic
Opening, even though you have the option to use elements of set
openings, absolutely nothing is planned, and anything goes. Whereas
all of the previous set openings we have described have a structure
and very specific rules, the Organic Opening essentially has only two
rules: listen to each other and create patterns.
An Organic Opening should still fulfill all of the objectives of any
Long Form opening. It should generate ideas for scenes, help develop
group mind, and entertain the audience.
The performance of the Organic Opening is similar to the
performance of organic scenes. You will get into agreement with your
fellow performers at the start and work together to recognize and then
develop comic patterns.
Commitment is paramount to the performance of the Organic
Opening. Because you will feel less certain when performing the
Organic due to the lack of form, there is a tendency to get in your
head and hold back until you are sure of what is going on. If you do
this, the opening will stall out. Go forward in spite of your fear. If
you commit, you will continue to contribute information that can
be turned into premises. Since everyone else on your team will be
committing, you can trust that the group mind will figure out how the
opening will proceed.

WHILE THE ORGANIC OPENING CAN TAKE ANY FORM, THE
FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE ESSENTIAL TO ANY OPENING:

Listening
Following the lead of the first person who responds to the suggestion
Creating loops of information (like in the Pattern Game, page 226)

Having each new section of the opening be inspired by the
suggestion or something from the previous pool of information

Continuing your opening until you have sufficient information to
perform scene work

Ending your opening by returning to something dynamic from
the beginning

The following exercise can be used to practice the sound and
movement element of an Organic Opening.

EXERCISE: FOLLOW THE
FOLLOWER

INSTRUCTIONS

A group of improvisers form a circle.

The improvisers will adopt a neutral position (e.g. head facing
forward, feet shoulder-width apart, arms hanging by their
sides, etc.).

The objective is to remain neutral, but not frozen. In other
words, no one consciously initiates any movements or “leads.”

The improvisers will scan the circle and should look to mirror
any slight movements or facial expressions that they see. This
could be something as simple as the twitching of an arm or the
subtle shift in weight from one foot to another.

Once two or more people are mirroring each other, the rest of
the group must join in.

At this point, a small sound that complements the movement
will be added by someone in the group. The entire group must
then mirror this sound.

From this point on, every repetition of movement and
vocalization must be heightened from the last.



CHAPTER TEN * Openings

Continue this heightening process until you can’t possibly
go any further, and the sound and movement necessarily
transforms into something else. It’s important to note that
again, there is no leader. No one is consciously transforming;
that will happen as a product of heightening.

After about three or more transformations, look to end the
exercise at a heightened moment.

ALTERNATE INSTRUCTIONS
A group of improvisers form a circle.
Someone outside of the circle gives them a suggestion.

This suggestion is used to inspire a specific sound and
movement. This means rather than starting from neutral, you
are starting with a choice. One person initiates with this choice,
which everyone else then mirrors.

The group then heightens and transforms this sound and
movement in the same fashion described above.

PURPOSE

This is a good way to practice getting in sync with other
improvisers when using sound and movement to generate
information. Sound and movement will be used in this way to
generate information in an Organic Opening.

Note: This exercise can also serve as a good warm-up for
improvisation since it allows you to practice, in an abstract sense,
what we are trying to do in organic Long Form scenes (start from

nothing and find interesting ideas to explore).

EXAMPLE

The following is an Organic Opening performed by a group of improv
students at the UCB Training Center in Los Angeles:

SUGGESTION: FUDGE

Since this suggestion is an object, it makes a member of the
ensemble think of the Invocation. They step out and address the
audience directly.

“It is poured on top of our most popular dessert.”



The rest of the ensemble continues with an Invocation for a
few moments.
At this point, the group breaks into sound and movement. One
member of the ensemble, inspired by the very last Invocation
statement, crosses the stage as a waitress, miming a tray of food and
drinks. She says, “Please be careful…very hot!”
Once again, the rest of the ensemble follows suit. Everyone
moves around the stage as waiters and waitresses, saying things like,
“Right behind you!” “Very hot!” and “Watch your back!” Through
commitment to the physicality of being members of a wait staff with
arms raised, holding trays, the group morphs into being airplanes.
Everyone commits to this new choice and adds a layer of airplane-
appropriate sound effects to their movement. Some members of
the ensemble start playing air traffic controllers, directing the
improvisers playing airplanes.
This then inspires a member of the ensemble to step forward and
tell a short, true monologue.
“I once went on a trip with some friends to Vegas. We boarded
the plane and my friend Bill immediately fell asleep. Bill hates to fly
so his strategy is to try and sleep through the flight. He was out for
about three or fours hours. He woke up expecting to be in Vegas and
was horrified to find out that the flight had been delayed and that we
hadn’t even taken off yet.”
This inspires another round of sound and movement. One
improviser begins weeping and moaning. The rest of the group
immediately follows suit. Everyone walks around the stage, crying
and consoling each other. This turns into a giant group hug.
While they’re in the group hug, crying and moaning, someone
decides to label their actions by shouting, “Me sad monster!” The
group starts to move around the stage as one character, playing the
“sad monster” together. They say things like, “Me so fat!” “Me eat too
much fudge watching romantic comedies!” and “Me also eat too much
human flesh!”
This inspires a member of the ensemble to step forward and say a
few lines of a character monologue directly to the audience.

Another student steps out to deliver a character monologue as
another depressed monster.
Yet another student steps out to continue this pattern.
The ensemble returns to the sound and movement for a third time,
creating an epic windstorm, physically running around the stage in
circles and making the sound of a gale force wind destroying everything
in its path. Improvisers label things we see flying through the air: a cow
flies by, then a goat, then an alpaca, then some alpaca breeders. As the
improvisers run past each other to physically create this storm on stage,
they make a callback to the wait-staff passing each other, once again
saying, “Excuse me,” “Right behind you,” etc.
An improviser breaks from the windstorm and faces the audience
to say:
The rest of the ensemble supports this move by calling back
memorable ideas from this Organic Opening.
This Organic Opening incorporated elements of the Invocation,
monologues and character monologues. The ensemble used sound and
movement as a bridge from one type of opening to another.
This ensemble listened to each other and committed to each new
choice. They took turns making strong choices and following the lead
of those improvisers making the strong choices. Each new move was
inspired by the last. The opening ended with a strong callback to how
it started.

Most importantly, this opening generated comedic ideas.
Here are three ideas that could be used for the first beat of
a Harold:

1. A premise scene about a man explaining that he loves
an acclaimed hour-long drama so much that he is
going to sleep until the next season begins.

2. Apremise scene about a meteorologist who rates the
power of a windstorm by what animals it is capable of
picking up.

3. Ahalf-idea scene starting with two pilots in the cockpit
of a plane that is being delayed. (Eventually they find a
game when they argue over who should have to deliver
the bad news to the passengers.)

4. As for group games, we could see the following
scenes: A premise scene about depressed monsters
attending a group therapy session.

5. Ahalf-idea scene about a wait staff trying to navigate
through an increasingly crowded restaurant.

WHY DO THE ORGANIC OPENING?

The fact that the Organic is so challenging is one of the primary reasons
why a group should work on it. It is an opening that is completely
improvised because there is no predetermined structure to fall back on.
Since it is one of the most difficult openings, it is also one of the most
satisfying to perform successfully. When performed well, an Organic is
also very impressive to the audience.

The Organic can also be very liberating. Since you have the freedom
to do whatever you want, it is fun to perform.

The Organic is the opening that is most likely to help an ensemble
break new ground. Groups who experiment with the Organic opening
often develop vital new set openings.

The Organic Opening is a great way for an ensemble to develop their
group mind. If your group can get on the same page and create funny
ideas in this very unstructured form, doing so in your scenes should
become much easier. There is no better opening for showing off your
group mind.

However, the challenging nature of the Organic also accounts for
one of its major drawbacks. The Organic is so challenging that it is very



difficult for new groups to perform successfully. It takes a long time for
most groups to get comfortable with the Organic. To overcome this, an
ensemble that wants to perform the Organic Opening should spend a
lot of time in rehearsal practicing it.
Another drawback of the Organic is that groups can be easily
seduced by its free-form nature and lose sight of generating,
identifying, and remembering ideas for scenes (the most important
function of the opening).
The main purpose of an opening is to generate ideas for scenes.
You don’t need an endless supply of ideas. Once you think you have
enough ideas to inspire the number of scenes your form requires, your
opening should be over. The more ideas you generate, the harder it
will be to remember the best ones. If there are five main ideas in an
opening, you are likely to remember them all. If there are ten main
ideas in an opening, you will probably forget some of them. If there
is an overabundance of ideas to choose from, it becomes more likely
that you will start a scene using an idea that your scene partner has
forgotten, making it more difficult for you to get on the same page.
Finally, if you generate more ideas than you end up needing, you run
the risk of your audience feeling disappointed that an idea they liked
wasn’t used.
It is not mandatory to begin a longform with an opening. Some
groups opt to launch directly into scene work off of a suggestion from
the audience. A group that has a strong group mind and has been
performing together for a long time will usually pull this off with
greater success than a brand new group.
A drawback of performing without an opening is that almost every
scene will be an organic scene. As the show goes on, you may find it
difficult to continue to come up with more ideas for scenes off of one
single suggestion.
We advise that new Long Form ensembles take the time to find
an opening that suits them. Working together to create premises will
make it easier for you to do successful scene work. Rehearsing and
performing an opening is also a great way to develop group mind and
establish a group identity. Additionally, the muscles you are forced
to exercise when performing an opening are the same muscles you
will use to perform the scene work that makes up the majority of any
improvised show.

It is easy to get in your head while trying to harvest ideas from an
opening, especially when you first begin performing a new opening.
It is important that finding inspiration in your fellow players be your
number one priority in the performance of any opening. If you listen
to them, you will connect to ideas together as a unit. If one of your
teammates makes a move, you should be the one to support it and make
them look great. Remember, as long as we are all working together and
supporting each other, the chance of success greatly increases.

SECTION THREE * CHAPTER ELEVEN

The Harold

The Harold is the grandfather of all
longform structures, and the signature
longform performed at the Upright Citizens
Brigade Theatres in New York and Los
Angeles. Del Close first created the Harold
in the 1960s. At that time, it was less
structured than it would become. Simply
doing a series of improvised scenes as a
cohesive whole was revolutionary. Over
his career, Del kept experimenting with
the structure. By the time he was the lead
teacher at the iO Theater in Chicago in the
1980s, he had arrived at the form we know
today. We studied at iO in the 1990s, where
we learned this structure.

Done well, a Harold has more depth than many longforms.
The structure requires you to revisit scenes and ideas more
than once. It also encourages you to have these scenes and
ideas connect and overlap by the end of the piece. Even
though everything is completely improvised, the scenes end

up being heightened and intertwined. When done well, it
feels like it must have been written.

The Harold is one of the most challenging longforms. It
requires you to make good scenes, revisit those scenes in
acertain order, and look for connections between them—
all while respecting group mind, and playing at the top of
your intelligence. This makes it a great teaching tool for
introducing longform structures in general. At the Upright
Citizens Brigade Theatre, the Harold is the compulsory
longform of our curriculum.

Structure
is usually performed by a group of six to nine
improvisers. It begins with a single suggestion from the audience. The
suggestion will be explored through an opening that is predetermined
by the ensemble before the start of the show. Any opening, including
the Organic, can be used to generate ideas for scenes in a Harold.
After the opening, a series of three scenes are performed, called
the first beat of the Harold. These first three scenes are generally two-
person scenes. The first beat is followed by a group game, which is a
scene involving most (or all) members of the ensemble. Three scenes
that make up the second beat of the Harold will follow. In the second
beat, the three games of the first beat scenes are explored through
further heightening and exploration. The scenes in the second beat are
presented in the same order they appeared in the first beat. A second
group game, unrelated to the first, follows the second beat of the
Harold. The show ends with the third beat of the Harold. In the third
beat, the three games are revisited once again. Your third beat scenes
should be shorter than your second beat scenes. You should look to hit
your game hard and move on. When performing a scene in this beat,
you look to incorporate elements from the other scenes. This is referred
to as making connections. In a “perfect” Harold, the third beat would
be one scene that organically incorporates elements of all three games.

THE PERFECT HAROLD

hile the “perfect” Harold (wherein elements and games from the

entire Harold are combined into one final scene) is the ideal, you
won’t always be able to achieve this. The connections you make must
organically present themselves. You do not want to force connections
if they don’t make logical sense. You don’t want to force an elephant
from a circus scene into a tea party scene just to make a connection.
If you absolutely can’t find any organic connections between the
games in your Harold, then you should perform three separate third
beat scenes. If you return to each game successfully, you will have
performed a successful Harold.

Perfect Harolds are rare. You are somewhat at the mercy of the fates.
If connections do not present themselves, they can’t be created. A
no-hitter in baseball is a victory, but so is having more runs than the
other team.

There are a few different
ways that you can think of
the structure of the Harold.
One way is to think of it as a
circle. Picture a circle in your
mind. Now imagine scanning
down the circle from the top.
It starts off narrow, gets wide
in the middle, and then gets
narrow again at the bottom.
Think of the top of the circle
as your opening. Think of the
middle of the circle as your
first and second beats of your



scenes and your group games. This is the point in the Harold where
you have generated the most disparate material. Think of the bottom
of the circle as the third beat of the Harold, wherein you can find
organic connections that tie everything together. A good Harold should
resemble a circle in this way.
Another way to think of the structure is as a diamond. Imagine going
down a diamond from the top. It starts at a single point, widens out,
and then comes back to a single point. Think of the single point at the
top of the diamond as your suggestion. The diamond gets wide as this
suggestion is expanded into different ideas. The diamond gets wider
still as the ideas are then explored in the scenes and group games of the
Harold. The end point of a diamond signifies the different games of the
Harold coming together in a single scene.
A final way to think about Harold structure is as paint being poured
over a sphere. If you poured paint onto the top of a sphere, it would
flow from a single point out in all directions, eventually coming
together at another point on the bottom. The paint pooling on the top
of the sphere is the opening. The streams of paint flowing towards the
bottom are the different scenes and group games of the Harold. The
streams of paint converging on a single point at the bottom of a sphere
represent the ideal organic connection of every scene.
Once your team has explored the suggestion through an opening, the
first beat of the Harold begins. The first beat consists of three different
scenes, each one inspired by some information generated in the
opening. These scenes are usually two-person scenes. It is possible
to do a first beat scene with more than two improvisers. However,
starting scenes with two people usually makes finding the game of the
scene easier.
The first beat is where you will find the games that will be played
throughout the rest of the Harold. It is essential that you establish a Who,
What and Where, as well as name the characters in each first beat scene.
Naming your characters will make it easier to revisit them later in the
Harold. The game of the scene will be found by initiating with a premise
or a half-idea generated in the opening. Once the game of the scene has
been found, the improvisers will heighten and explore it until another
improviser from the back-line edits the scene !"##$#%&’&()*$+,)#$-./0
Let’s assume our Harold starts with an opening that includes the Andy
Richter monologue about football, and the hypothetical “competing
grocery store” monologue, both of which are described in the
“Monologues” section of Chapter 10.

The first beat of your Harold might include a nail on the head scene

example. You can use any combination of “nail on the head,” “one step

YTPSP$cTL$(((H( .#$’*&+*’$1&2%89$1$<1#.-8$0-.$1$/-81#%-8$,%#:$
Be judicious about the amount of support work you provide in first
beat scenes. Remember, you cannot support someone else’s game until
they have found it. Too much support work early in a first beat can
prevent improvisers from finding a game. You do not want to hijack
someone’s scene.
The most important job you have in the first beat of someone
else’s scene is to pay close attention to it. That way, you will be able
to support the game of the scene when necessary. This support may
take the form of editing, walk-ons, tag-outs, split scenes, cut-tos, scene
painting, sound effects, offstage characters, etc.
Whereas much of the above support is optional, the edit is
essential. You must be paying close attention in order to edit the
scene on a high note.

CONNECTIONS

PAY ATTENTION

tis important to pay especially close attention to the first beat

scenes of a Harold, in order to ensure that you recognize and
remember the games and specifics of these scenes. Paying attention
to the first beat will allow you to support the games as they are
revisited throughout the Harold. This will allow you to use these
games and specifics in the form of callbacks and connections later in

the Harold.

DEFINING YOUR GAMES

In the moment after your first beat scene is edited, try to distill or sum
up the game into as few words as possible, so you will be able to return
to it in the second beat of the Harold. Remember, this is not the Who,
What, and Where (or the plot) of the scene; it is the game, which made
your scene funny.

The games (as well as the many times, characters, and locations)
established in the first beat will be returned to throughout the rest of

the Harold. Each first beat scene should have its own distinct game.
Starting your Harold with three scenes that are very disparate in terms
of content and ideas will cause any connections that you make in the
third beat of the Harold that much more impressive and satisfying.
If you incorporate specifics from one first beat scene into another
first beat scene, it difficult to find your own game and later make
connections in the third beat.
After the first group game (explained in further detail later in this
chapter), the ensemble will return to each game from the first three
scenes in what is called the second beat of the Harold. Whereas in the
first beat you are finding the game, in the second beat you are finding a
new scenario to play the game you have already found. You can revisit
the game in one of two ways: time dash or analogous. In a time dash
second beat, you are returning to one or both of the same characters,
playing the same game in a new scene that takes place sometime before
or after the first beat scene. In an analogous second beat, you are
playing the same game in a different context with different characters.
Whichever choice you make, you will be making some changes to
the Who, What, and Where. You make these changes in order to give
yourself new opportunities to play your game.
Don’t feel like you need to make your second beat better than your
first beat. Simply return to your game. Think of sitcoms. They aren’t
looking to make each episode better than the last; they are just finding
new, fresh scenarios for their characters to play their games.
Continuing on from the first beat of the scenes inspired by the Andy
Richter monologue, we might see the following second beat scenes.

YTPSP$d[L(((T( -80.-8#1#%-8$6+#,++8$.%517$&*<+.’1.2+#$
Because it is the simplest choice and causes the least confusion,
most second beat scenes will feature the same two improvisers who
performed the first beat of the scene, whether the second beat is a
time dash or analogous. The character you portray in the second beat
should fulfill the same game function in the scene as the character
you portrayed in the first beat. In other words, do not switch roles. For
example, the improvisers who played the art museum guide and the
patron in Scene 1C will play the minister and parishioner, respectively,
in their analogous second beat. Had they chosen to perform a time dash
second beat, the improvisers playing the art museum guide and the
patron would return to those same characters, respectively.
However, this is not the only option. It is also possible for a second
beat scene to include the same two improvisers from the first beat
scene, plus additional improvisers from the group. For example,
Scene 2B in our example Harold will feature the same two improvisers
who played the supermarket employees in Scene 1B, plus additional
improvisers from the back-line who will play employees from the rival
supermarket. Again, the improvisers from Scene 1B should not switch
their roles from the first beat. Adding new improvisers to a second beat
scene is only ever done to serve the game of the scene.
The second beat usually provides more opportunities for the back-
line to make support moves, because the game has already been
established. Depending upon how the game is being heightened and
explored in the second beat, walk-ons, tag-outs, and other support
moves are now more likely to be welcome additions to the scene. For
example, the back-line might applaud as audience members at the
ceremony in the “athletic awards ceremony celebrating violence”
scene. Scene 2B !18&9,5$">+#86,8<#’$),()"$73(283(’,’&3(:0 will likely

feature other improvisers supporting the scene by playing members of
either gang. In Scene 2C !16&(&"’#8$,"<&()$+,8&"?&3(#8$238$,$%3(,’&3(:0,
an improviser from the back-line could tag out the priest to play a
guardian angel who hints that he “guards better” when donations are
made. Notice that all of these support moves are made in the service
of the game. Ideally, good support work will provide opportunities
for the improvisers already on stage to play their game. Good support
work should always make the improvisers already on stage look better.
Support work is not just an opportunity for you to get more stage time.
As in the first beat, the only mandatory form of support in the second
beat scenes are well timed edits.
It can be deceptively difficult to perform a second beat scene. You are
not just taking the story or the characters from the first beat into the
second beat. You are also taking the game, which can be hard to define
even after you have played it successfully in the first beat. The game is
what provided the humor in the first beat scenes. This is what we want
to further explore in the second beat, rather than a plot progression of
the first scenes.
In order to bring the game back in a second beat scene, you must
first be able to identify it. You identify your game by asking yourself,
“What was funny about that scene?” and “Why was it funny?” or, more
specifically, “What was the consistent pattern of behavior that was
funny?” Try to sum up your game in the least amount of words possible.
Using as few words as possible will help you to boil your game down to
its essence. If you can sum up your game in about five words or so, it
will help you to think of another situation in which to play it.
For example, you might boil down the game of Scene 1A to
“celebrating an unfortunate outcome of doing your job well.” This is a
good summation because it boils the game down to the point where you
have excluded the specifics of the scene. This puts you in position to be
able to use the game for either a time dash or analogous second beat.
A poor attempt at boiling down the game of Scene 1A would be
“rowdy football practice.” Football practices are often “rowdy.” This
description does not include what was unusual or interesting about the
scene (celebrating the broken arm).
Another poor attempt at boiling down the game of this scene would
be “a football player who got his arm broken.” This example does
nothing but describe the plot, and could lead to a plot-focused second
beat scene in which the football player does nothing but ask people to
sign the cast on his arm. A problem with both of these examples is that
the descriptions are tying the game to the specific of football. Football
is a detail supporting the game, not an essential element of it.

Once you have identified the game of the first beat, your main
responsibility when performing a second beat is to provide new
opportunities to play the game of the scene. Changing one or more
elements of the Who, What and Where will provide these new
opportunities. While it is possible to return to the same Who, What and
Where for the second beat of your game, it stands to reason that you
will have used up many of the opportunities for game moves in the first
beat. Therefore, you will have much more available to you if you start
with a new Who, What, and Where.
Part of the process when bringing a game back is to decide whether
the game is served best by a time dash or an analogous second beat.
Again, whether you choose time dash or analogous, you will probably
be best served by making some specific changes to the Who, What,
and Where. Note, these changes to the Who, What and Where are not
arbitrary changes into which you then try to fit your game. Rather, you
will choose which elements of the Who, What, and Where to change
based on what will provide the most opportunities for playing your
game. The changes you make should prevent you from repeating the
same game moves you made in your first beat.
Let’s revisit our example first beat scene about the art museum
employee asking a patron for a donation with implied threats. Now let’s
imagine that you exhausted the majority of possible game moves for
this particular scenario. It would be a fruitless path to stick with the
same Who, What and Where, and stay in the museum for your second
beat. When creating a second beat for this scene, you would need to
make some changes to the Who, What, and Where in order to provide
new opportunities to play your game. Changing the Who to a minister
and parishioner, and the Where to a church, gives you a whole new
world of details that you can use to play the same game.
Now let’s look at the problems you could run into if you arbitrarily
change the elements of the scene. Imagine that you arbitrarily changed
the Who to gangsters for the second beat of this scene. This is a change
that would not support your game. Since gangsters do extort people
with the threat of implied violence, this change actually neutralizes the
humor of the game. Or, let’s imagine that you arbitrarily changed the
Where to a ticket counter at a bus station for the second beat of this
scene. This is a change that does not support your game since buying
bus tickets doesn’t involve making a donation.
In your second beat, you should get right to playing your game. This
is possible because you are bringing back the game you established in
the first beat. You don’t have to spend any time discovering the game.

CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

EXERCISE - DISTILLING
THE GAME

INSTRUCTIONS

In order to introduce yourself to this process, you should begin
by distilling the game of a successful written comedic sketch that
everyone knows.

The first step is to offer a short comedic synopsis of the sketch.

Now see if you can still describe what is funny about this sketch
after stripping away the specifics. Distill the game by boiling it
down to the funny behavior. You will be best served if you can
limit this description to five words or less.

Once you have distilled the game, see if you can use this
description to come up with ideas for analogous second
beat scenes.

Once you are comfortable doing this, you are ready to perform
this process using a scene that your group has improvised.

EXAMPLE
SNL’s “Coneheads”

Comedic Synopsis: Space aliens with cone-shaped heads poorly
attempt to blend into human society.

Game Distillation: Poor Attempts at Blending In

Analogous 2nd beat idea: Undercover cops in full uniform
with only stereotypical accessories unsuccessfully try to pass
themselves off as drug users. They use stilted, dated street slang.

Analogous 2nd beat idea: A forty-year-old man trying to pass
himself off as a twelve-year-old in order to get a low-priced
movie ticket. He uses a high-pitched voice and talks about how
much he loves Nickelodeon shows.

PURPOSE

This exercise will help you to better succinctly isolate the game of
your scene.

Doing this exercise often will also make you better at coming up
with second beats more efficiently.



RAISING THE STAKES

hen you perform a second beat scene, do not burden yourself

with the goal of being “funnier” or “better” than your first
beat scene. As stated earlier, the goal of a second beat is simply to
provide new opportunities to play your game by changing one or
more elements of the Who, What and Where. This misguided pursuit
of being funnier or better in your second beat often manifests itself
through improvisers “raising the stakes” of the second beat. Raising
the stakes means to arbitrarily choose a high-stakes scenario (e.g.
meeting with the president, a deathbed scene, etc.).

Far from guaranteeing a successful second beat, arbitrarily raising
the stakes will cause you to perform second beats with Whos, Whats,
and Wheres that don’t necessarily serve the game of your scene.
Consistently forcing games into high-stakes scenarios in the second
beats of scenes will result in repetitive and clichéd scenes (e.g. Whos
such as the President and the Pope, Wheres such as weddings and
funerals, and Whats such as surgeries and gunfights).

Let’s say you performed a first beat scene about a 40-year-old
businessman who has a terrible problem with authority. Every time
he encounters an authority figure of some sort, he starts acting

like a rebellious teenage punk. Let’s say in the first beat scene,

the businessman had an encounter with his boss about his recent
productivity on the job.

Let’s say that you approach the second beat of your scene by
focusing on “raising the stakes” of the scene. To do so, you put the
businessman with the President of the United States. While this
setting will technically work, it is no better than, for instance, putting
the businessman with the person in charge of restocking a salad bar.

BUSBOY: “Excuse me, sir...you have to use the tongs.”

BUSINESSMAN: “Whoa! So you’re the big man in charge, huh?
Gonna ride me, try to keep me down?

The “salad bar attendant” scenario works for this game without
raising the stakes. In fact, you could argue that this scenario is better
than a scene in the Oval Office because it is more absurd to rebel
against a person with very limited authority.



An ideal second beat initiation will allow the improvisers to hit the
ground running by immediately playing the game from the first beat.
An important part of performing a second beat scene is to fashion
an initiation that clearly and concisely communicates which elements
of the Who, What, or Where you are changing, and what response you
are looking for from your scene partner. For your second beat of Scene
1C (“art museum guide asking patron for a donation”), your initiation
might be, “It’s good to see you. You and your family are, of course,
always welcome in the house of the Lord, but He does recommend
donations, (threateningly) and I think you know what He means by
‘recommend.’” This initiation adheres very closely to the structure of
the first line of the first beat. While this example makes the second
beat idea very clear, know that a second beat initiation doesn’t always
need to parallel the first beat initiation so specifically. Another
possible second beat initiation for this scene could be, “I couldn’t help
but notice from up at the altar that you didn’t put any money in the
donation plate today. For your sake, I hope that hell isn’t as horrible as
we imagine it to be.”
Furthermore, the person who initiates the first beat doesn’t
necessarily have to initiate the second beat. For instance, although the
museum employee initiated Scene 1C, it is possible for the person who
played the patron to initiate the second beat. If you were playing the
patron in the first beat, your second beat initiation might be, “Father,
are you suggesting that a failure to contribute to the collection plate
might result in eternal damnation?” This line not only makes the
changes to the Who, What, and Where clear, but it also implies that
your scene partner, a priest, has already delivered a veiled threat and
should continue to do so throughout the scene.
Beyond formulating a clear and concise opening line for your
second beat, how you take the stage in a second beat is important. Be
the first to step out on stage, and take your position confidently and
purposefully in order to indicate to your scene partner that you have
a second beat initiation in mind. When your scene partner from the
first beat scene joins you, deliver your clear and concise opening line.
It should let your scene partner know who they should be playing to
support your idea. Your initiation should also make it clear whether
or not you want additional improvisers from the back-line to join the
second beat.
If you are not the first to step out, you should assume that your scene
partner has an initiation, and you should remain neutral. Remaining
neutral means stepping into the scene without making a choice about
the Who, What or Where before hearing your scene partner’s initiation.
Once they have offered an initiation, your job will be to find a way to
complement their choice. Whether or not you initiate, you should have
formulated your own initiation between the first and second beats.

You need to be ready to initiate in case your scene partner does not.
However, do not try to synthesize or “combine” initiations. If your scene
partner initiates before you do, drop your idea and go with theirs.
Now let’s look more closely at how to perform time dash and
analogous second beats.
A time dash second beat involves either one or both of the characters
from the first beat scene. If you named your characters in the first beat,
you should use one or both of those names to make it clear that you are
returning to characters that have already been established.
The term “time dash” refers to the fact that, since you are returning
with one or more characters from the first beat, you are necessarily
going to have to move either forward or backwards in time. Otherwise,
you’d be simply repeating the original scene. This change in time can be
anything from starting exactly where you left off in the first beat, to two
years later, to an hour earlier, etc.
You take the second beat to another place in time not to follow
plot or story, but instead to take the audience to another point in the
character’s life that would be a good situation for you to play the same
game. Where you jump to should be entirely dependent on serving the
game. Think of time dash as a device for getting to a new situation with
the most opportunities for playing your game. A time dash allows you to
bypass extraneous and uninteresting events that may logically lead up
to the point where you want to play your game, but would not add to the
entertainment value of the scene. You don’t have to go to “what’s next”
chronologically. Time dash allows you to jump to the next fun moment
for your game. Don’t ask yourself, “What happens next?” Ask yourself,
“When and where will our game happen next?”
For example, Scene 2A (“supermarket gang confrontation”) is a
time dash second beat that involves both characters from the first
beat later in time. We have placed the store clerks in the middle of a
confrontation between rival supermarket gangs. This may appear to
be a plot progression since we have followed the character from being
initiated into the supermarket gang to fighting a rival supermarket
gang. However, this “plot progression” is an incidental result of playing
your game. This second beat situation is simply a fruitful new way to
play the same game. (To reiterate an earlier point, following plot is
acceptable if you are doing so in service of the game.) The meeting of
two rival gangs provides new opportunities to play the game of the first
beat. Also note that we’ve passed over the car ride or walk that must
have happened to get the characters to this meeting, the discussion of
how this fight would be conducted, etc.

CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

Now let’s look at some bad examples of time dash second beats for
this game:

¢ Asecond beat in which one of the store clerks is at home telling his mom
about gang activity at the supermarket. This second beat does nothing
more than report the game from the first scene to a new character. It does
not actively play the game in a new context.

« Asecond beat scene that merely takes place in a supermarket, leaving
out the gang-warfare aspect. This scene might be initiated with a line
like, “I finished mopping up aisle six. I’m gonna take my break, okay?”
This initiation does not include the game or a new context to play it in. It
only uses the Where of the scene. The success of this scene would depend
on the other improviser steering it towards the game by finding ways to
incorporate gang warfare. It is unlikely that the other improviser will do
this because they will assume that the initiating improviser has an idea for
playing the game since they stepped out first.

* Asecond beat scene in which two security guards discuss a recent
supermarket gang fight. This is a poor second beat because they are
talking about what should have been the second beat, instead of actually
performing it. We’re missing the gang fight, which provides the greatest
potential for playing the game.

You could look at most comedy movies as a series of time dash second
beats that follow “the game” of the main character in the movie. For
example, once Jim Carrey has the powers of God in Bruce Almighty, the
movie puts him into a series of different situations that provides further
opportunities to play this “game,” an ordinary man with the powers of
God. When he is near a body of water, Bruce can simply walk across the
water instead of using a bridge. When we see him at his apartment in
the morning, Bruce gets coffee by willing Juan Valdez to appear at his
window. When we see him outside of his ex-girlfriend’s school looking
to reconcile with her, Bruce makes clouds form the shape of a heart in
order to get her attention. Each new scene that sets up Bruce to make
each of these “game moves” is like a second beat for the “ordinary man
with the powers of God” game.

Don’t let the name “time dash” make you think that moving
backwards or forwards in time, or the degree to which you do so, is in
and of itself what will make your second beat successful; it is only a
byproduct of remaining with the same two characters. Sticking with
the same characters will necessarily force you to move forward or
backward in time.



If one or more of the characters were the fun aspect about a first beat
scene, it is probably a good idea to try and revisit them in a time dash
second beat. Whether you bring one or both of the characters from the
first beat into a time dash second beat will depend on whether that best
serves the game of your scene.
The other way to approach a second beat is to start an analogous scene
that plays the same game, but with two new characters in an analogous
situation. Even though the characters and the situation are completely
different, the fundamental game will remain the same.
Let’s look at a simple analogy:
A “doctor” is to a “patient” as a “mechanic” is to a “car.”
Both examples include a profession and what that profession
repairs. Therefore, the two pairs of words are fundamentally the same
while being specifically different. Two situations that are fundamentally
the same while being specifically different are what we want for
analogous first and second beats. The fundamental sameness between
the beats will be the game. The specific differences will be the changes
made to the Who, What and Where.
Let’s imagine a first beat scene in which a high school teacher
is teaching a student. A high school teacher and a student have a
relationship that is analogous to a drill sergeant and a private (in both
cases, one character teaches the other). So, the same game can likely be
played using either set of characters.
Now let’s imagine a first beat scene with the same characters but a
different What. Rather than the student being taught by the teacher,
the student is serving detention under the teacher. In this case, a more
apt analogous second beat scene might involve a prison guard and

prisoner, since it better mirrors the relationship of “person in charge
monitoring detainee.” The Who, What, and Where for your analogous
second beat are chosen depending on what will best allow you to play
the same game from the first beat.
The game must also be part of your analogy. Let’s look at an example
in which we include a game in our first beat. Let’s say our first beat was
about a firefighter who was scared of fire. In order to understand our
game, we should try to give it a title that doesn’t use any specifics. We
might call this game “fear that would preclude a person from doing their
job.” Once we have boiled our game down to its essence in this way, we
can find potential analogous scenarios. We could, for instance, perform
analogous second beats by playing a lifeguard who is scared of water, a
podiatrist who has a foot phobia, or a dentist who is afraid of teeth.
Now let’s look at a set of example scenes that were performed on
stage at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. A first beat was performed
that involved a boxer who had a crush on his opponent. The first beat
scene played out this situation as far as it could go. We saw the conflicted
boxer asking his corner man how his trunks looked. We saw him try to
get himself into a clinch with the other boxer without throwing a punch.
We saw him give out his phone number while he hit the other boxer with
jabs. By the end of the scene, the team had exhausted the possibilities
of the game of “having a crush on someone with whom you have an
adversarial relationship” in the context of two boxers involved in a fight.
The team then made the wise decision to return to this game in
an analogous second beat. Since being in the ring and fighting is the
most extreme manifestation of the adversarial relationship of these
two characters, it would not serve the game to time dash to a different
scenario where this adversarial relationship is explored to a lesser
degree (for example, the boxers meeting in their twilight years on an
ESPN retrospective). The “crush” aspect of this game is funniest when
juxtaposed with the violence of fighting.
To see a rematch also wouldn’t work because they exhausted a vast
majority of the possible game moves involving a fight scenario in the
first beat. We might see these two boxers go out to eat after the match,
but then we are losing a big part of the game because there would be no
reason for the boxers to be aggressive towards each other.
The analogous second beat they performed involved a cop who had
a crush on the criminal he was interrogating. The game was exactly the
same, even though both characters were completely different and in
an entirely different situation. They didn’t need to return to the boxers,
because they were only specifics supporting a game. The first beat
scene was not really about boxers; it was about the game of having a
crush on an adversary.
Here is an example of an analogous second beat scenario for the
boxer scene that would not have worked: an ice cream vendor has a
crush on his customer. They could not have played the same game

in this scenario. With this choice, they would have only retained the
“crush” element of the first scene. An ice cream vendor and customer
don’t have the same sort of adversarial relationship that two boxers
have. We have lost the humor that was being derived from the crush
getting in the way of an adversarial relationship.
An advantage of analogous second beats is that they will create more
variables to be used as your group looks for connections towards the
end of the show. To successfully perform an analogous second beat, you
must pare down the first beat’s game to its essentials, leaving out the
specifics. Doing so should make it easier to find a new Who, What, and
Where to play the same game.
The main idea to keep in mind when choosing between time dash and
analogous for your second beat is “form fits function.” One type of
second beat is not considered to be superior to the other. You want to
make your choice based on what is going to best serve your game. You
want to determine which second beat option will give you the most
opportunities to play your game without being repetitive.
If you can change the Where and the What, and have the same
Who be just as funny, then you will be able to time dash. If you change
the Where and the What, but there are not as many opportunities for
the Who to be funny with these new specifics, then you should go
analogous and change all three elements of your scene (the Who, What
and Where).
Let’s say our first beat was about a guy telling dirty jokes at a funeral.
You easily can imagine this same character being just as funny in
different situations involving different “wheres” and “whats” (a doctor’s
office, a child’s birthday party, a church, etc.). You don’t need to change
the Who in these new situations.
Now let’s return to our boxing example. It is hard to imagine our
“who” from the first beat (the boxers) being as funny in a new “where”
and “what.” A boxing ring in the middle of a fight are the “where” and
the “what” offering the most game moves for this “who.” Since there is
not a new “where” and “what” that will provide as many opportunities
to play the game with this character, you need to find an entirely
different Who, What, and Where (i.e. an analogous scene). A cop in a
police station interrogating a criminal will provide a whole new world
of specifics to be used to play the same game.
When characters have no relationship outside of the context of the
first beat (e.g. customer and convenience store clerk), you should also
choose analogous over time dash. If it would be odd or unlikely for
these characters to meet again in another context, you should think
of an analogous situation for your game. Let’s imagine our boxers
meeting up again at car wash or a restaurant. Putting the characters in

CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

one of these situations would feel forced, and would not provide new
opportunities to play the game.

Whether you choose to perform a time dash or analogous second
beat, it is important to remember that the goal of both is to play the
same game that you played in the first beat.

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE GAME
ISN’T CLEAR?

ne of the challenges of the Harold is that you must do a second

beat of every first beat scene, regardless of how the first beat may
have gone. So, what do you do when you fail to find a game in the first
beat? The general rule is to start out your second beat with the most
specific or unusual thing you remember from the first beat, and Yes
And from there. Another way to think about this process is to think
of it as “following the fun.” Even when a scene goes poorly, there is
usually at least one thing that is fun about it. When the scene ends,
ask yourself, “What was the most fun part of this scene?” and start
your second beat there.

For instance, you may have actually had a game in your first beat, but
are just struggling with how to define it. Your second beat should be
fine if you “follow the fun.” What you identify as fun will probably be
very close to the game, and will hopefully lead to you to playing it
again in the second beat.

Or perhaps your first beat scene was scattered. Instead of focusing on
and building off of the first unusual thing, you and your scene partner
continued to discover and/or generate multiple unusual things. In this
case, pick the unusual thing that was most fun, and try to be more
specific by using “If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?”
to find and play a single game in the second beat.

Sometimes, however, you and your scene partner will have
absolutely bombed. In this situation, there was a complete absence
of laughter in reaction to your scene. In other words, there is no

fun to follow in this scene. In these situations, you can take solace

in the fact that you have nowhere else to go but up. Reassess your
thought process when starting the first beat scene. Did you have an
idea from the opening? Can you try to be more specific in hitting your
idea directly in the second beat? If you were starting organically, the
problem may be that you never were specific enough in establishing
the Who, What, and Where for your audience. Go into your second
beat with the intention of making stronger choices and being clearer
and more specific.



After a second group game, the ensemble will perform the third beat
of the Harold. The same games will be hit once again. The third beat
is where you wrap up your Harold. As such, third beat scenes will be
shorter than the previous scenes. Think of them as a summation of
your games. Imagine a speech. After the speaker says, “In Conclusion,”
you would not expect them to continue speaking for as long as they
have up to that point. Since the third beat is the conclusion of your
Harold, it should be very short. For instance, sometimes a successful
third beat scene can be as short as three lines.
In each third beat scene, you will not only be playing your game
again, but you will also be looking to incorporate the games or elements
of the other scenes of your Harold into the scene being performed. As
you perform a Harold, you and your teammates will create a number
of scenes that, on the surface, will seem to have little in common.
However, if you look at them closely, with a little imagination you
should be able to find organic connections among the various themes
and ideas generated in your Harold. These connections will allow you
to end your show in a satisfying way in the third beat. Connecting
scenes gives the Harold the feel of a whole theatrical piece, as opposed
to a collection of disparate scenes. Furthermore, tying elements
together at the end of the show will give it the appearance of being
written or planned, which is always a goal of great improv.
Third beats may seem daunting, but in fact, they should be the
easiest part of the Harold for you to perform. By the time you have
reached the third beat, you have already played the game of the scene
in two other beats. In order to perform a straightforward third beat
scene, you only need to ask yourself, “How could I take my game to
another situation that will provide other opportunities to play it?” If you
have already followed your characters from the first beat into a time
dash second beat, you should time dash them to a third beat scene.
If you took your game into an analogous situation from first beat to
second beat, you should go analogous again.
While your Harold will be technically correct if you simply play each
game again in the third beat, you can achieve a synergistic effect by
making connections between your scenes. In a connection, a character,
element, or even the entire game from one scene is transplanted into
another scene. There should be some thematic overlap or similarity
between the elements of the games that are coming together in a
connection. In other words, connections should be logical and not
forced. Connections are a way to remind the audience that the scenes
of your Harold exist in the same world. They give your absurd ideas and
premises a life beyond the scenes they are in.

The football players from Scene 1A (“football team celebrating
violence”) could appear at someone’s door asking for a donation for
new uniforms, with an implied threat of violence. This is a logical and
unforced connection between the game of Scenes 1A and 1C. Asking
for donations is something that student football teams normally
do. Additionally, since the football players in this Harold have been
established as violent characters, their threatening behavior in this
situation seems logical. You could classify this as a planned connection.
In a planned connection, an improviser steps out from the back-line to
perform a scene with an idea for a connection already in mind. Planned
connections are intentional and premeditated.
Now let’s imagine that one of the improvisers from Scenes 1C and 2C
(“asking for donations with an implied threat of violence”) steps out
to perform an analogous third beat scene by playing a Salvation Army
Santa Claus asking for donations from passersby with an implied
threat of violence. The improvisers from Scenes 1B and 2B recognize a
potential connection and step off of the back-line as the supermarket
gang members. They make it clear that the Santa is standing in front
of their supermarket, and they confront him for trying to make
money on their turf. This is an example of a discovered connection.
The improviser who initiated the third beat scene did not plan the
connection; it was discovered in the moment by another improviser on
the back-line.
Now let’s imagine a scene in which a college recruiter is at the home
of the football player who won the award for outstanding violence
in Scene 2A. He is talking to the football player and his parents. The
recruiter says, “Alabama is very excited about your son. I’ve seen how
many boys he’s put in the hospital. If he comes to our school, he’ll not
only get a chance to send more kids to the ER; he’ll get a degree and
we’ll keep him out of the supermarket gang culture.” A college recruiter
scouting this football player on the basis of his violent behavior is
simply a continuation of the game from Scene 2A. The reference to
“supermarket gang culture” is an example of a callback connection. A
callback connection is a quick reference to something from earlier in
the Harold. Again, a callback connection reinforces that everything

happening in your Harold exists in the same world. Like discovered
connections, callback connections will occur to you in the moment.
Callback connections are not confined to the third beat of the Harold;
they can technically happen anywhere from the second beat of the
Harold on.
A callback connection is a good tool to use if you need an edit point
for a scene. An audience will likely laugh at something that is familiar
to them but returns unexpectedly.
Forced connections come off as illogical and random. There is no value
in arbitrarily throwing elements of different scenes together. Having
the museum guide from Scene 1C show up as an assistant coach of the
football team doesn’t serve either game, and it feels very forced. Forced
connections will not be satisfying to the improvisers or the audience.
Connecting the games or elements of the three separate scenes of the
Harold in the third beat is incredibly rewarding to both the audience
and the improvisers on stage. Since all of the ideas started from the
same single suggestion, everything in your Harold is already connected
from the start of your show. The scenes of your third beat allow you to
bring out those connections for your audience to see.
By the third beat of your Harold, you will be looking for a high point
on which to end your show. Simply continuing to play your game may
not provide this high point. You will want to hit the audience with
something they don’t expect. A well-executed connection can do just
that. A strong organic connection will almost always guarantee you a
strong “out” for your Harold. It is the “magic trick” that will leave your
audience wondering, “How’d they do that?”
Some people think that a perfect Harold would end with a
connection of all three first beat scenes in a way that would allow for
each of the games to be played again. Remember, while connections are
something to aspire to, a lack of them won’t ruin your Harold. A Harold
isn’t a failure if things don’t connect. In fact, a show that simply ends by
continuing to play the various games of the Harold in the third beat will
be more successful and enjoyable than a Harold ending with illogical
or forced connections. We make connections when they present
themselves to us. If a strong connection presents itself, go for it.
You should approach your third beat by using what is already “on the
table.” You don’t want to invent new ideas; you want to use what already

exists. As with second beats, your first priority when performing a
third beat is always to continue playing the game of your scene. Your
secondary priority is to make connections, whether they are planned
connections, discovered connections, or callback connections. Make
looking for connections the focus of your support from the back-line.
Don’t let searching for connections distract you from your game, which
is most important for the success of your third beat scene.
Third beats only succeed when a team is working together. When not
performing in your own scene, you should make it your priority to look
for connections from the back-line. With many minds working towards
the goal of connections, what might at first seem daunting becomes
relatively easy, since the entire ensemble shares the burden. Hopefully
this will leave the audience thinking not about how funny one person or
one line of dialogue was, but how the ensemble came together to create
something too cohesive to have been created entirely on the spot.
A group game is performed between both the first and second beats and
the second and third beats of the Harold. The two group games of the
Harold are independent of each other. In other words, the second group
game is not a “second beat” of the first group game. The name “group
game” refers to the fact that most (or all) of the ensemble performs it,
and, as is the case with any scene, the focus will be on a single game.
The entire group will work together to heighten and explore this single
game. Group games offer you the possibility to be nontraditional,
abstract, and/or presentational in the playing of your game.
Many of the concepts and principles that make a two-person scene
successful also apply to group games. The entire ensemble must get
on the same page at the start of the group game. You must look for and

make simple patterns. Give and take must be utilized. Once a game has
been found, the ensemble must commit to the pattern of this game and
not complicate the scene through arbitrary invention.
Group games are an opportunity to use premises generated in your
opening that haven’t yet been used in the Harold. Group games can also
be a good time to use the audience suggestion in a very direct way. This
can benefit your Harold, as sometimes your opening will take you so far
away from the suggestion that the audience is left confused as to what
your show has to do with their suggestion.
Since you won’t be returning to a “second beat” of your group games,
it is justified and valuable to heighten at a quicker pace than you might
in a scene performed in one of the beats. This will give momentum and
variety to your Harold. Having the entire ensemble focus in on, play
out, and aggressively heighten a game gives a burst of energy to your
show that will carry you into the next beat.
An improviser can initiate a group game either verbally or nonverbally.
A verbal group game initiation always includes a line of dialogue. A
nonverbal group game initiation involves one improviser initiating
with a sound or a physical action, as opposed to a line of dialogue. In
nonverbal initiations, the improviser initiating the scene has only made
a choice about the Where or the What but has left other decisions about
the scene up to the rest of the ensemble through support.

The rest of the ensemble can respond to a group game initiation in
one of two ways: Add On or All At Once.
Add On Group Games always begin with one additional improviser
joining the initiator. The rest of the performers in an Add On Group
Game will then add to the scene through walk-ons. The improviser
initiating the scene does not dictate how the rest of the ensemble will
add to the scene. Each improviser joining the scene determines his or
her own “who” and function in the scene, as long as their walk-on is
in keeping with the base reality and—if it is already established—the
game of the scene. Once a game is clearly established, every successive
walk-on will ideally offer further heightening or exploration.
It is important to note that in Add On Group Games, you do not have
to wait for the initial improvisers to find a game before contributing
to the scene. The improvisers on the back-line in a group game can be
active in the creation of the game.
All At Once Group Games begin with most, if not all, of the
ensemble joining the scene immediately after the initiation.
You don’t necessarily need every improviser to step out for an
All At Once scene. In fact, it is often a good idea to have one or two
improvisers remain on the back-line. This is called hanging back.
There are many benefits to hanging back. If an improviser or two
hang back, they will be available for support work. An improviser
on the back-line can offer support moves that will add variety or
heightening to the game. Furthermore, the “undefined” improviser
on the back-line will have the most objective perspective on the scene,
and will therefore be in the best situation to give the scene what it
needs the most.
The ensemble must always listen carefully to the person initiating
a group game so that they can support that person appropriately.
When initiating verbally, the improviser initiating the scene will
be able to strongly suggest if they want the rest of the ensemble to
support by adding on or joining in all at once. The ensemble should
be able to tell what the improviser is looking for based on that first
line of dialogue. For example, if an improviser initiates by saying,
“Gentlemen, we need to discuss these quarterly numbers,” they
have strongly suggested an All At Once response by dictating to
the rest of the ensemble that they will be executives in a business
meeting. In an improviser initiates by saying, “If you’ll take a seat,
Mr. Blackwell, we can go over the quarterly numbers,” they have
strongly suggested an Add On response by addressing just one
other member of the ensemble.
When you initiate nonverbally, you are leaving the decision of how
to add onto your initiation up to your teammates. Whether the group
game ends up being Add On or All At Once is left to the rest of the
ensemble’s discretion.

PRESENTATIONAL GAMES

“Presentational group games” are a common and useful type of
verbal group games (both “Add-On” and “All At Once”).These are
group scenes in which a performer, or performers, address the
audience directly: lectures, press conferences, town hall meetings,
etc. They also include television shows in which the characters are
addressing the camera: news reports, talk shows, game shows,
commercials, etc.

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATIONAL GROUP
GAME INITIATIONS:

EXAMPLE 1: “Hello, members of the press. As your mayor, I’m ready
to take questions regarding the recent decline in the
quality of karaoke singing in our town...”

EXAMPLE 2: “Tonight on Dateline we will yet again shake your faith
in humanity by telling you about the murder of an
innocent person by a depraved sociopath.”

EXAMPLE 3: “Class, settle down, I’m ready to begin my lecture on
the role of frogs and toads in World War II.”

Presentational group games will sometimes involve improvisers
entering the actual audience in order to portray members of the
fictional audience in the scene. For instance, in example 1 above,
improvisers would likely enter the audience and portray reporters
asking the mayor questions about the decline in the quality of
karaoke in town.

Note that presentational group games do not “break the fourth wall,”
which is something we do NOT recommend doing. While improvisers
do address the audience in presentational group games, they do not
do so ina way that causes the audience to view the performers as
improvisers doing an improv show, or view themselves as audience
members watching an improv show. Rather, the improvisers present
themselves as fictional characters in the scene, treating the audience
as the fictional audience they are addressing. An example of breaking
the fourth wall would be an actor turning to the audience and saying,
“Perhaps it would have been better if the six-foot-six member of our
group hadn’t chosen to play a preschool student in this scene.” Clearly,
a move like that would completely undermine the reality of the scene.



Let’s look at some examples of each type of group game initiation and
the responses that could follow:
An improviser steps out on stage, puts out two chairs, and sits down in
one. He says, “This is my first time eating at the Rainforest Café, Nancy.”
This is verbal since we are starting with a line of dialogue. Because
the improviser is addressing one other character, the appropriate
response from the rest of the ensemble would be for one person from
the back-line to sit down in the second chair. Because of this scene’s
placement in the Harold, the ensemble knows this is a group game.
Therefore, each improviser on the back-line will be looking for the
appropriate opportunity to add onto the scene through support moves,
such as walk-ons or tag-outs, until everyone (or nearly everyone) in the
ensemble has participated in the scene.
An improviser steps out on stage, facing the audience. He says, “I am a
bonobo. I am a gentle and intelligent primate.”
Since the ensemble should be looking to make patterns, the
most likely response would be for another improviser to add on by
addressing the audience as another animal found in the rainforest.
An improviser initiates by stepping out and facing the audience. They
being to narrate a story by saying, “Once upon a time in the land of
Slackerville, there was an underachieving boy named Bongo who
wanted to procure a driver’s license.” At this point, another member of
the ensemble steps out to play Bongo.
This is a verbal initiation. The ensemble will continue to Add
On, either by playing other characters set up in narration or by
participating in the narration.

An improviser steps out on stage, faces the audience, and mimes
holding a protest sign. He says, “We are protesting the destruction
of this rainforest, and we are not moving until those machines are
turned off!”
This is verbal since we are starting with a line of dialogue. This time,
the improviser initiating is indicating that he is part of a group. The
appropriate response from the rest of the ensemble would be to join in
All At Once.
An improviser steps out on stage and holds his arms up into the air as if
they are branches of a tree. He turns to his teammates and says, “Trees
of the rainforest, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are all
going to have to support a few more organisms than we are used to.”
This improviser has established himself as a tree, and has indicated
to the rest of the ensemble that they should join the scene All At Once,
also playing trees.
An improviser steps out and mimes holding a microphone. Addressing
the audience directly, they say, “Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to
‘The Stupidest Person in America.’ Let’s meet our contestants.” Let’s
imagine that the rest of the ensemble joins in immediately. Three
members play the contestants. Everyone else runs out into the seats to
play the live studio audience.
This initiation let the ensemble know that they would be performing
in the style of a game show. This initiation strongly suggested an All At
Once response from the rest of the ensemble.
An improviser steps out, mimes a podium, and addresses the audience
by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to talk
about our town’s problem with cat overpopulation.”
The rest of the ensemble immediately plays residents of the town,
either from the back-line or by taking places in the audience.

Unlike verbal initiations, wherein the decision to add on or join in
all at once is dictated by the initiating improviser, with nonverbal
initiations, the decision to add on or join in all at once is left entirely to
the back-line.
An improviser steps out on stage and begins with nothing more than
the physical action of pitching a tent.
At this point, we know that the initiation is non-verbal. One other
improviser steps out and mimes rolling out a sleeping bag. Through the
lines of dialogue that follow, we find out that they are members of the
same Boy Scout troop on a camping trip. An ensemble that is paying
close attention to the start of this scene can assume that they should
continue to Add On by playing other members of the troop, the Boy
Scout leader, etc.
The group game starts with an improviser stepping out to silently
mime swimming upstream as a salmon. One other improviser steps
out to play another salmon. Then another improviser steps out to play
waves. Another improviser then steps out to play a dam that the fish are
jumping over. The salmon begin talking to each other. The ensemble
has responded by adding on one by one.
An improviser steps out on stage and faces the audience. He mimes
snapping a picture with a camera.
This time, the entire ensemble (except for one improviser who
chooses to hang back) enters the scene and begins snapping pictures.
After a few seconds of snapping pictures without dialogue, one
improviser addresses an unseen celebrity on the red carpet.

An improviser steps out on stage and faces the audience. He mimes
putting on noise-canceling headphones and firing a gun.
The entire ensemble (except for one improviser who chooses to
hang back) enters the scene and stands in a line as other people firing
guns at this shooting range.
If any members of your ensemble have not had a chance to
participate in one of the first beat scenes, the rest of the ensemble
should be sensitive to that and give their teammates a chance to initiate
the group games. However, if after waiting a moment or two, one of
these improvisers has not stepped out to initiate the group game, you
can and should step out and offer an initiation, even if you initiated a
scene in the first beat. You never want your show to lose momentum
due to hesitation.
With their added emphasis on listening and reacting, group games
reflect the ideals of team play and group mind in Long Form.

CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

EXERCISE EXAMPLE: BUILDA
MACHINE

One member of the ensemble steps out and embodies
a component of a machine by performing some sort of
mechanical, repetitive motion along with a sound effect.

While the first member of the ensemble continues their sound
and motion, the next member will add a new component that
complements what has already been established in some way.

One by one, the rest of the ensemble will continue to add to
the machine.

Each member of the ensemble must maintain his or her sound
and motion until the final member of the ensemble steps out.

The final member of the ensemble will shut off the machine
and explain what this machine does, by activating each
component of the machine and describing it. Whena
component is “activated,” that improviser will resume his or
her sound and motion.

The purpose of this exercise is to work together as a single unit.
The goal of the improviser describing the machine should be
to go into detail in describing every component such that each
member’s contribution is acknowledged.

VARIATIONS ON THE EXERCISE

Have the last member of the ensemble explain the machine
while trying to “present” or “sell” it to the audience.

Have your group build a “monster” instead of a machine. In
this variation of the exercise, each member of the ensemble
is creating a living, moving being, piece by piece. Each new
improviser will form another part of the monster. Once the
monster is completed, the ensemble will move around the
stage, working together as one organism.



EXERCISE EXAMPLE: BUILD AN
ENVIRONMENT

This exercise starts with one person initiating a physical action
(without talking) that suggests a specific environment. The
environment should be one that you could reasonably imagine
six to eight people in.

The other improvisers will enter one at a time and add other
physical actions in keeping with the environment established

by the first improviser. (For example, if one person initiates by
tossing pizza dough in the air, you could assume that you are in

a pizzeria. The next member may enter and start rolling dough or
man the oven or wait in line as a customer.)

Improvisers are allowed to create sound effects, but these must
be true-to-life sound effects (e.g. don’t say “mop-mop-mop”
while mopping; make the sound a mop would make).

Once all members of the ensemble have entered the
environment, sweep edit and start over.

This exercise teaches an ensemble to establish and agree ona
location quickly at the start of a group game.

THE ROLE OF TAG-OUTS IN GROUP GAMES


ag-outs can be used in group games, but you should hold off on
using them until most or all of the ensemble has contributed to

the scene. The goal of the group game is to allow the entire ensemble
to improvise together. Using tag-outs too early can work against this.



CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

GROUP GAMES EXERCISES

Below are some exercises that will allow your ensemble to practice
performing group games with specific, predetermined structures.
Since you won't need to worry about finding the type of group game at
the start, your ensemble will be able to focus on finding and creating
comedic patterns, and playing game together as a group.

EXERCISE: THE “Il AM” GAME

INSTRUCTIONS

Half of the group will take the stage and the other half of the
group will act as an audience.

One member of the ensemble steps off of the back-line and
directly addresses the audience.

This improviser makes a statement in the following format:
“lam .” This blank is filled in with an inanimate object.

After this improviser declares their object, they should take a
few lines to describe the object’s actions, thoughts, feelings,
beliefs, or opinions.

The improviser embodies the object both verbally and physically.

Asecond improviser will then step out to play a different
inanimate object, adhering to the same “I am ” format,
followed by a few lines of further description. The second
improviser will be looking to establish a pattern of some sort.

A third improviser will step out to play a different inanimate
object, speaking in the “lam ” format once again.
This third improviser will follow the pattern established by
the second. If they do so, the pattern begun by the second
improviser will be locked.

Once the other improvisers on the back-line have established
each of their inanimate objects, the ensemble will continue to
describe their inanimate objects, adhering to the pattern that
has been established.



EXAMPLE

PLAYER 1: “I AM A HERSHEY’S CHOCOLATE BAR. I’M THE
BEST CANDY BAR BECAUSE I’M A CLASSIC. I’M
OLD SCHOOL.”

(PLAYER 2 finds it interesting that the Hershey bar is bragging
about being the best. He establishes a pattern by playing
another candy bar that is also bragging.)

PLAYER 2: “I’M A BABY RUTH. I’M SO GOOD, THEY NAMED ME
AFTER THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER WHO
EVER LIVED.”

(PLAYER 3 recognizes the pattern of bragging and locks it with
the following move.)

PLAYER 3: “I’?M A WHATCHAMACALLIT. I’M SO
INDESCRIBABLY GOOD THAT PEOPLE CAN’T
EVEN GIVE ME A NAME.”

(The ensemble continues this pattern until every member has
added on as another candy bar making a case for its superiority.
The ensemble members then continue to make their cases for
superiority through give and take.)

PURPOSE

* This is exercise will force your ensemble to practice
performing Verbal Add On Group Games.



CHAPTER ELEVEN - The Harold

EXERCISE: THE AD GAME

INSTRUCTIONS
Four or more members of the ensemble take the stage.

Another member of the ensemble comes up with an unusual product
by taking an ordinary item and giving it an unusual trait (e.g. a car
that changes color based on its surroundings, or a refrigerator that is also
a radio).

The ensemble will work together to create an advertising campaign
for this product.

They will work together to come up with a name for the product, a
slogan, a target demographic, a celebrity spokesperson, a jingle, etc.
All elements of the campaign should complement each other.

For example, if Player 1 says, “We could call it ‘The Chameleon,”
then Player 2 could say, “Yeah! We could have Meryl Streep be the
spokesperson. She could talk about how she disappears into her
roles just like this car disappears into its surroundings.”

No matter what idea is thrown out, the entire group must support
and Yes And it.

Now let’s look at an example of a full improvised ad campaign for
the car that changes color based on it’s surroundings:

PLAYER 1: “We could call it ‘The Chameleon.”

PLAYER 2: “Yeah! We could have Meryl Streep be the
spokesperson. She could talk about how she
disappears into her roles just like this car disappears
into its surroundings.”

PLAYER 3: “Yeah, she could start off the commercial as Julia Child
and then finish the spot as Margaret Thatcher.”

PLAYER 4: “We could sell it to criminals. If the police
are chasing them, they can blend into their
surroundings and hide.”

PLAYER 3: “We could take helicopter footage of a police chase
and suddenly, the car disappears, blending into
the highway!”

PLAYER 2: “When you don’t want to be seen, this is
your machine.”



PLAYER 4: “Great slogan. (singing) ‘This car’s named after a
lizard that can hide, buy this car and camouflage
your ride,”

PURPOSE

¢ This exercise will force your ensemble to practice performing
Verbal, All At Once Group Games.

* This exercise will help you strengthen your ability to listen,
Yes And, and utilize give & take.

DON’T BE A STAGE HOG

Probably the most important thing to avoid during a group game is
becoming a “stage hog.” You should do a lot more listening and a lot
less talking in group games than you would in most two-person scenes.
In a two-person scene, you are responsible for half of what is said.

In a group game, you are one of many improvisers. While there are
exceptions to the rule, generally if there are eight people on your team,
you are probably only going to have to do 1/8 of the talking in the scene.

BEWARE OF MOB MENTALITY

There is a tendency when more than two people get on stage to throw
the basic rules of good improv out the window. However, the more
people you have on stage, the greater the potential for chaos. Therefore,
the more important it becomes to follow the rules of improv.

Some mob mentality pitfalls:
¢ Making independently funny moves instead of following a pattern
* Talking over each other

« Making patterns out of unintentional mistakes (a mispronounced word,
not having enough chairs for the group, etc.)

¢ Cutting off the initiating improviser before they can fully express their idea
* Clinging to a pre-conceived choice that does not fit the initiation

¢ These pitfalls can result in loud, sloppy scenes that devolve into a string
of easy jokes that undermine the integrity of the group game. The way to
avoid this is to adhere to the basic rules of good improv.



The Harold, although seemingly very simple in structure, is actually
quite challenging. If you want to perform Harolds that transcend
funny and stand out as exciting pieces of art, you must be ready to
dedicate a lot of time in rehearsal to the form, preferably with a steady
cast and some sort of coach or director to help guide your progress.
This time will be well spent, as the Harold encompasses all of the
basics you will need to perform any longform. Becoming adept at
the Harold will put you on the path to success in all longforms. For
more information on practicing, see the section titled “Rehearsal &
Performance” later in this book.

In this chapter we introduce you
to a few other longforms we have
performed at the UCB Theatre.
Topics covered:

The Movie
The Movie is a longform that involves six to nine improvisers
performing a fully improvised 30-minute movie in a particular genre.
Performers use the language and techniques of screenplays and
filmmaking to present things on stage that would be impossible to
present physically. Through description, you will be able to create
everything from breathtakingly beautiful sunsets to battles scenes
featuring thousands of people.
The opening of the Movie starts with a single suggestion. From
this single suggestion, the ensemble will set up three separate
settings (by describing location, props, atmospheric sound, and
lighting) and a character or characters (by describing age, gender,
wardrobe, and demeanor) within those settings through narrative,
third person description. This third person description is referred
to as scene painting. Through this scenic and character description,
the ensemble will also establish the genre of the movie. This scene
painting is performed in a give & take fashion by the entire ensemble.
Each improviser builds off of the image described by the previous
improviser by adding an additional detail, then adding his or her own
idea to the scene.
Once a character is mentioned, someone from the ensemble will
step into the setting to become this character, remaining silent as the
rest of the ensemble describes both the character and the setting. The
improviser playing the character should, however, actively inhabit the
space being described (e.g. typing in an office, pouring a cup of coffee
in a kitchen, hammering boards at a construction site, etc).

CHAPTER TWELVE « Other Longforms

COMMON DESCRIPTION MISTAKES

PUPPETING

Any time a character is described in the Movie, you must be careful
not to “puppet” this character. Keep your descriptions as brief as
possible. You don’t want to do the work of the improviser playing
the character. You only need to provide the essential information
needed to get the improviser started. Do not describe every action
from moment to moment. All that needs to be established are

key character traits. You can, however, describe actions that help
establish the specific type of character we are seeing.

TELLING NOT SHOWING

In the Movie, the ensemble should describe things about characters
that are non-visual. They reveal backstory, what the character is
thinking, or even what the character’s game will be throughout the
Movie. An example of back-story would be to reveal the character’s
place of birth (e.g. An abusive father in a backwoods cabin brought
him up). If you were to show what a character is thinking, you might
say something like, “The character is thinking about how he can’t
wait to get home and relax in a hot tub.” The following is an example
of forcing a character game: “This character seduces every woman he
comes in contact with, regardless of her age or physical appearance.”
As is the case with puppeting, the danger of “telling and not showing’
is that you are taking power away from the improviser by making too
many decisions about their character for them.


The following is an example of a good character description that
avoids “puppeting” and “telling not showing” (please note that this
description would come from the collaboration of multiple members
of the ensemble):

“We see a gruff-looking police officer. He isn’t wearing an official
uniform, but we know he’s a cop because of the badge hanging
around his neck. He is wearing a grimy-looking sleeveless
t-shirt covered in stains. He has his feet up on his desk and is
smoking a cigarette.”

The ensemble has described a very specific character archetype: the
“loose-cannon” police officer. The specificity of the character will
help the entire ensemble focus in on the genre of their Movie. While
this description gives a lot of specific information and provides an
archetype character for the improviser, the improviser is still given
the freedom to make all of the choices concerning his dialogue and
behavior in the moment and later in the Movie. The description



of physical actions such as “putting your feet up on a desk” and
“smoking” are not considered to be puppeting because they give
essential clues about what type of character this is.

Now let’s look at an example of bad character description in which
the ensemble resorts to “puppeting”:

“We see a gruff-looking police officer. He puts his feet up on his
desk. He crosses his right leg over his left leg. He reaches his arms
back and folds his hands behind his head. He furrows his brow.”

The mistake being made in this description is that the ensemble has
overly focused on moment-to-moment actions that do not elucidate
the character.

Now let’s look at an example of bad character description in which
the ensemble resorts to “telling not showing”:

“We see a gruff-looking police officer. He looks around the
precinct, thinking about how many of the rules he is going to
break today. He’s had a bad attitude ever since his partner was
killed in a shoot-out. He also has a bad habit of using unnecessary
force to deal with every criminal he encounters. He looks for
every opportunity to tell the chief to ‘shove it.”

The primary mistake the ensemble has made in the above example

is that they are describing things that are non-visual. In a Movie, the
characters should be revealed to an audience through dialogue and
action. The above “description” is more like narration from a novel.
Additionally, the ensemble has likely diminished the audience’s
enjoyment of the remainder of the movie by revealing the character’s
“funny” behavior before it surfaces.

You don’t have to know everything that is “funny” about a character
by the end of the opening. By offering a few strong, specific, essential
details of a character, you are giving the improviser playing the
character a base reality to build from.

It is very important to identify a genre by the end of the opening, as
this will provide you with a simple, generic plot outline to follow so that
your primary focus can be on finding a game in each scene. Note that
the three settings of the opening should have no obvious connection
outside of the genre.

Let’s say the first setting of an opening establishes the sheriff at

the jailhouse in a small town. The genre being hinted at after this first
setting is a Western. Two settings that fit within this genre (without
forcing an obvious connection) would be a setting with a singer in



a saloon and a setting with a rancher on the outskirts of town. Two
settings that would fit within the genre but force a connection would
be a setting with a sheriff’s deputy at the saloon and a setting with the
sheriff’s wife at her home. Forcing a connection between the settings
established in the opening will cause the plot to collapse upon itself
too early.
Once the third and final location is established, a member of the
ensemble will step forward and offer a title. Try to avoid taking the
title as an opportunity to just say something funny. The title is your last
chance in the opening to try to lock in the genre for both your group
and the audience. An audience that knows what genre you are working
in is much more likely to understand and enjoy the show. Titling the
movie is also the cue that the opening has ended, and that it is time to
start scene work.
Once the title has been established and the opening is finished, the
improvisers who played characters in the first setting step out into the
same established setting and start the first scene with dialogue. The
ensemble will return to each of the three settings established in the
opening, in order. These first three scenes are where the character
and scenic games that will be played throughout the rest of The Movie
are discovered.
From this point on, you will add settings and characters as needed
to service your plot and your games. It is likely that you will end up
with far more locations and characters than you would in a Harold.
Also unlike the Harold, in which each game is given equal weight, the
genre of a Movie will cause certain characters or plotlines to return
more often than others.
Your primary responsibility is to simply play the character games
and scenic games that have been established. You will also look for
connections appropriate to the genre. It is not your responsibility to
come up with a clever plot. Instead, you will simply hit the archetypal
plot points of the genre you are performing. The Movie ends when you
come to an archetypal ending appropriate to your genre.
Creating spectacular and detailed scenes will require the
involvement and attention of the entire ensemble. Compared to other
forms, the Movie may be the most exhausting. It takes a lot of energy
from the entire group to transcend simple scene work and present a
vivid cinematic experience for the audience.

As is the case with all Long Form scene work, the scene work in your
Movie must have a base reality. You must first establish a base reality
before you can find and play your game. In a Movie, the base reality is
provided by the genre. Every scene within your Movie will start with some
bit of genre-specific base reality (i.e. something that would happen in the
genre, played the way it would happen). From this point on, you will Yes
And until you find the first unusual thing. The first unusual thing in any
scene is anything that departs from the genre. In the Movie, playing at the
“top of your intelligence” means that anything not tied to the game of the
scene will be played as you would expect it to be in this genre. Del Close
referred to this as “paying tribute to the genre.” (Note: within the Movie,
the game of the scene will always be found organically. You will never
enter a scene with a premise because the opening of the Movie does not
provide premises or half-ideas; it only provides a base reality.)
Genre alone does not equal game. Genre provides a context within
which to play your game. Simply playing the genre is not enough. If you
only play the genre instead of games, you will only end up with jokes,
references, and mere laughs of recognition from the audience.
For instance, if your genre is “George Romero zombie movies,” a
zombie bursting into a room is not going to count as a first unusual thing.
Even though this would be very unusual if it happened in real life, in
George Romero zombie movies, zombies bursting into rooms are part
of the base reality. But if one of the characters in the scene then starts
complaining about the property damage the zombie is doing to his home,
this would count as a first unusual thing. That’s because the expected
response from a character like this in an actual zombie movie is panic,
fear, or violence towards the zombie.

As stated earlier, the plot of any Long Form Movie should closely
mirror the plot of an archetypal movie within the genre being
performed. This is not cheating! Remember, Long Form shows are
never about the plot; they are always about the funny ideas or the
games. By following an expected or typical plot, your ensemble will
know which scene or character to jump to next, freeing everyone to
focus instead on finding, playing, and connecting games.
There is one key distinction to be made between plot in actual
movies and plot in Long Form Movies. It is important to realize that your
ensemble will only have thirty minutes to accomplish what is normally
done in ninety minutes or two hours. Put your focus on playing those
moments and scenes that are the most essential and recognizable.
The Movie takes standard cinema techniques and applies them to
the stage. The ensemble uses cinematic terminology (close-ups, cut-
aways, over-the-head shots, etc.) in their descriptions to help the
members of the audience visualize what is happening on stage in a
cinematic fashion.

Close-ups are used to focus the audience’s attention on a character,
an important action, or a significant detail in a scene. Close-ups are
initiated verbally. At any time, any improviser can say, “Close-up on
________.” The improviser initiating the close-up will also frame with
his hands who or what is being put in the close-up. [WE NEED A
DRAWING HERE] At this point, the improviser can go on to describe
details of the close-up =#4)4$>?#$.##$1$!/(7@2#$%*$.8#1!$/6’’(’)$-%8’$"(.$
*17#:A$%/$>?#$72%.#36&$%’$"#/$"1’-$/#17"(’)$*%/$!"#$)6’AB. The rest of the
improvisers need to employ give & take, and hold their dialogue until
the description is done. In order to end a close-up, any improviser from
the ensemble can give the direction, “Cut back to the wide angle.”
In The Movie, the cut-to is used as an edit to end one scene and start
the next. Any improviser in the ensemble can call out, “Cut to ________.”
The blank will be filled in with a basic description of the next scene
!1<2#DAB. As opposed to simply editing and trusting that someone will
step out and do something, The Movie requires the editor to specifically
call out what location and/or characters they want to see next.
Low-angle or high-angle shots can be used to convey a more specific
visual look for a scene. If you want to show a low-angle shot of a
character in the Movie, first announce it =#4)4$>C6!$!%$1$2%831’)2#$."%!$%*$
!"#$-#!#7!(,#AB. Then use your hands to create a frame low to the ground,
pointed up, representing the perspective of the camera. [DIAGRAM] For
high-angle shots, you announce the shot$=#4)4$>C6!$!%$1$"()"31’)2#$."%!$
%*$!"#$-#!#7!(,#AB$and then use your hands to create a frame above the
characters. You may even want to get up on a chair to establish a high-
angle shot.
Low-angle and high-angle shots add to the aesthetic of the Movie and
can help you further nail down your genre. These shots are often used in
scenes of confrontation in films to illustrate which character holds the
position of power. The subject of a high-angle shot will look vulnerable
and insignificant on film. The subject of a low angle-shot will seem
powerful and imposing$=#4)4$E1/!"$F1-#/$(.$6.6122;$."%!$1!$1$2%831’)2#B.
Using these shots in the Movie is a way for the improvisers on stage to
flesh out the characters and their relationships to each other.

The pan mimics the swinging horizontal or vertical movement of the
camera in a film. You can use pans to reveal someone or something out
of frame =#4)4$>?#$&1’$!%$/#,#12$1$01’$26/@(’)$(’$!"#$."1-%8.AB or to show
more of the setting$=#4)4$>?#$&1’$17/%..$1’$#21<%/1!#$7"(2-G.$<(/!"-1;$&1/!;$
Sometimes it will be appropriate for the characters in the scene to
move off stage as the camera is panning off of them. Additionally, new
characters may have to step into the scene in order to represent what is
being focused on in the pan.
Sometimes pans are used to simply give the ensemble a chance
to more fully describe the setting in a scene; they don’t need to
necessarily reveal a new character. In this situation, the character
originally in the scene should still move off stage to ape the effect
of the camera moving past them, but the environment should be
included either through verbal descriptions from the back-line or by
other members of the ensemble stepping out to play prominent or
significant pieces of the environment.
Tracking shots are used to follow a character as they move through
their environment. In order to initiate a tracking shot, someone from
the ensemble will step forward and say, “we cut to a tracking shot of
________,” and then frame the person being tracked. The character will
mime moving through space =8"(2#$17!6122;$/#01(’(’)$(’$&217#B$as the
rest of the ensemble creates the effect of a changing background. They
can do this through description or by moving through the frame as
objects or other characters that the main character is moving past. You
can also do tracking shots of objects.
POV shots are used to show the audience a specific character’s point of
view. A POV shot is initiated when a member of the ensemble says, “we
cut to the ________’s POV.” If what you are describing in the POV shot is
small and specific, it may be necessary to frame it with your hands (e.g.
“a spot of blood on a shirt”). The improviser initiating the POV will then
describe what is happening in the shot. Since we are trying to show
what a character is seeing, the character whose POV we are seeing will
actually leave the stage when a POV shot is called. Other improvisers
will enter the stage to become the characters, objects, or environment
described in the POV.

To rack focus means to change the
plane of focus from one character
or object to another within a single
shot. To initiate a rack focus, a
member of the ensemble will say,
“We rack focus from ________ to
________.” The initiating improviser
will then create a frame around
whatever they are rack focusing to.
Let’s say that we are watching
a scene in which a hardboiled
detective is rummaging through a
desk. An improviser from the back-
line could step forward and say,
“we rack focus from the detective
to a door that is opening slowly
behind him.” The improviser
initiating this shot will create a
frame around the door to focus the
audience’s attention on it.
Reverse angles are used to show what is happening in the opposite
direction from what we’re currently seeing =HIJ$-#)/##.$*/%0$!"#$."%!$
76//#’!2;$<#(’)$-#&(7!#-B. To initiate a reverse angle, a member of
the ensemble will say, “Cut to a reverse angle. We see ________.” The
improviser initiating the shot should establish the new information
being revealed by the reverse angle. For example, in a scene about a
doctor performing a surgery, a reverse angle could reveal a group of
medical students watching the surgery being performed.
When a reverse angle is initiated, the scene will “flip” 180 degrees,
with everyone currently in the scene maintaining his or her position
relative to the other performers. Improvisers that were originally
facing forward will now have to turn their backs to the audience. Other
improvisers may need to join the scene to portray characters being
revealed by the reverse angle.

Split screens are used to show action occurring in two different
locations simultaneously. To initiate a split screen, a member of the
ensemble will say, “We split screen to reveal ________.” The improviser
initiating the split screen will then step out to physically split the stage
with their arms, while describing the new scene being added to the
stage. New improvisers will step out as needed for this new scene. The
improvisers in the two scenes will take their places on either side of the
improviser who is “splitting” the screen. For example, in a scene where
we see a girl getting ready for a date, a split scene could be called to
reveal her date also getting ready.
Chyrons are electronically generated captions superimposed on a
television or movie screen. In the Movie, chyrons are a device used to
establish information about a character or a setting through text on
screen. To initiate a chyron, a member of the ensemble from the back-
line will say, “We see a chyron appear on screen that reads ________.”
(e.g. “On the lower half of the screen a chyron appears: The Canary
Islands, June 15th, 1944.”)
A crane shot is a shot taken by a camera on a crane to show action from
above. To initiate a crane shot, a member of the ensemble will say,
“We see a crane shot as the camera pulls away from this scene.” The
ensemble doesn’t do anything physical to represent a crane shot; it is
left up to the audience’s imagination. Crane shots can add emotional
weight to a key moment in your Movie. Since crane shots are commonly
used to signify the end of a movie by moving up and away from the
characters in the scene, they are an effective way to cue the rest of your
ensemble that you have reached the end of the Movie.
A slow motion sequence is used to add dramatic emphasis to moments
of action, high emotions, etc. To initiate a slow motion sequence in the
Movie, a member of the ensemble simply says, “We see this sequence
in slow motion.” The improvisers in the scene will immediately slow
down their movements. Characters in the scene modify their voices to
mimic the effect of slowing down film.

These shots add relatively little to the improvisation in a scene. They
are support-based moments that are funny because of their physical
nature. Gimmick shots allow your ensemble to show off for the
audience. While they are fun, they should be used sparingly.
An over-the-head shot in cinema occurs when the camera is looking
down upon the action of the scene from directly above it. An over-the-
head shot is initiated when a member of the ensemble says, “we cut to
an over-the-head shot of this scene.” To recreate an over-the-head shot
on stage, the improvisers in the scene are picked up by improvisers
from the back-line and held so that the tops of their heads are facing
out to the audience.
A Matrix shot mimics the iconic scene in the movie The Matrix in
which the camera revolved 360 degrees around a frozen moment. When
someone from the ensemble initiates a Matrix shot, the entire scene,
meaning everyone on stage, maintains their position relative to each
other while rotating 360 degrees on an axis in the center of the stage.
A Dutch angle is when a camera is tilted approximately 45 degrees.
When a Dutch angle is initiated, everyone on stage will lean to the side
to give the effect of the camera being on tilted to the side.
These are only a few examples of innumerable gimmick shots. You
may be able to come up with other gimmick shots by devising ways to
physically represent actual cinematic techniques on stage. Remember
to use gimmick shots sparingly. While gimmick shots are funny, they
neither further the plot nor play the game.

The following are some examples of Movie openings to give you a sense
of how they are created.
Let’s imagine that an ensemble asks for the suggestion of a song lyric:
Taking inspiration from this song lyric, an improviser establishes the
first setting of the opening by stepping forward to say:
%&#’!()*+ ,)>B)DTBN)DN)H)VLHGDXS)UHCW)HFFBS5)>B)VBB)H)
Another improviser steps forward, and takes over the scene painting
by saying:
%&#’!():+ ,)3LB)CHMBRH)TEVLBV)JLRDEZL)JLB)HFFBS<)
Once this is said, an improviser from the back-line will step out
and play the man in the overcoat that is being described. Another
improviser steps out and says:
%&#’!()@+ ,)!QBRSJLINZ)XB0RB)VBBINZ)IV)IN)UFHCW)HNG)
At this point, the improviser portraying the man would mime lighting a
cigarette. The improviser already speaking then says:
%&#’!()@+ ,)gXLBN)LB)FIZLJV)ET<)XB)VBB)JLHJ)JLB)MHN)
Given what has been established so far, the ensemble has strongly
suggested that the genre of this movie is “film noir,” and that the
character being described is a private detective.
At this point an improviser might edit this setting entirely by saying:

PLAYER 4: “Cut to, interior ofa train. The car is filled with
people dressed in 1940s clothes. Women are
in knee-length skirts and high-heeled shoes.
The men are in suit coats and hats.”

Another improviser takes over and says:

PLAYER 5: “We pushin ona newspaper. The newspaper
lowers, revealing a pair of suspicious eyes.”

An improviser from the back-line steps out to play the man with the
suspicious eyes. A new improviser takes over the scene painting:

PLAYER 6: “The man is sweating. He folds the newspaper
and places it on the seat next to him. He
begins nervously clutching a briefcase.”

Another improviser steps out and continues:

PLAYER 7: “Close up on the man opening the briefcase
to reveal 20 fake passports, all with his face
but different names.”

The ensemble has further established the genre by adding another
archetypal film noir setting and character.

Another improviser from the back-line edits out of this scene to the
third and final setting of the opening by saying:

PLAYER 8: “Cut to exterior, cemetery. A group of people
dressed in black stand ina light drizzle.”

Multiple members of the ensemble will step forward from the back-
line to play this group of people. A new improviser takes over the scene
painting, gestures towards one specific improviser in the group on
stage, and says:

PLAYER 4: “We move in close on one woman wearing
a black veil covering her eyes, with tears
streaming down her face.”

A new improviser steps out and says:

PLAYER 6: “Dramatic music swells as the title fills the
screen in big, white block letters: ‘The False



CHAPTER TWELVE « Other Longforms

EXAMPLE TWO: PARTIAL OPENING

The inspiration for the Movie does not have to be a song lyric. This
following example shows just the first setting of an opening inspired by
nothing more than a single word.

SUGGESTION: CORN

PLAYER 1: “We open on a cornfield and the sun is
just peeking over the horizon. We can see
workers in the field...”

At this point, multiple improvisers can step out to play the workers.

PLAYER 2: “...the workers are covered in sweat and have
leathery skin from long hours of hard labor.
We angle on the foreman’s cabin. Tough and
confident-looking, the foreman stands outside
of the cabin with a gun over his shoulder...”

To angle on the cabin, this improviser would create a frame with
his hands and physically angle the scene away from the workers
towards where he imagined the cabin would be in this shot. Once
the foreman is mentioned, a new improviser will step out and
silently play this character.

PLAYER 3: “...the foreman is standing next to a spittoon.
We see that he has a big wad of chewin
between his gum and lip. He is looking out
at the workers in the field...”

Note: while this is a very good character description, the improvisers have
not yet nailed the foreman down as an archetypal character. In this case,
his archetype will become apparent in relation to the other main characters
described later on in the opening.

Notice that this improviser is only describing what he can see, not
puppeting the improviser portraying the character. This allows the
improviser playing the character to make choices about the character’s
behavior in the moment when this setting is returned to later in
the Movie. Player 3 has only set up enough information about the
character so that the other improvisers know the general direction of
the scene and genre. The improviser playing the foreman will now be
able to find his own actions, specific characteristics, and game as the
Movie unfolds.



The above description establishes our first archetypal character in the
Movie. By describing the worker in the field as “ruggedly handsome,”
and by having him do something benevolent, we are strongly
suggesting that this is the hero or main character of the Movie. Now
that we have identified this character as the hero, it is likely that the
tough foreman described before is the villain.
This improviser has started the description of the second setting in
this movie. Again, the ensemble will work together in describing this
new setting and the characters that inhabit it. The genre is still being
determined at this point, but we do have some clues as to what it may
be: key words like “spittoon” let us know that this movie is happening
in the American past. Since steam locomotives were used from the start
of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century, the genre could
be anything from a Gold Rush Western to a Dust Bowl Grapes of Wrath
style period drama. This second setting is in keeping with the first. The
ensemble will work together in this new setting and a third to continue
to get more specific about the genre of the Movie.
Let’s take a look at another Movie opening. This is a transcription of
an actual performance of the Movie done by a class of UCB Training
Center students. To inspire their Movie, they got the suggestion of
someone’s favorite song lyric.

CHAPTER TWELVE « Other Longforms

PLAYER 1: “We open ona computer-animated version
of Albert Hall! We hear the sound of
classical music playing as the camera pans
over an orchestra playing on stage. The
camera moves over the crowd and we see
aristocrats in the seats. The camera begins
to move up...”

PLAYER 2: “...And we move up, up, up into the very
top of Albert Hall, where we see a tiny
computer-animated cockroach.”

At this point, an improviser stepped out to play the cockroach.

PLAYER 3: “This entire movie is animated. The
cockroach is listening to the music intently
and he has a miniature conductor’s baton in
his hand...”

PLAYER 4: “...he’s got a giant smile on his face and his
antennae are forming music notes as the
music plays...”

PLAYER 5: “...and standing right next to him isa
caterpillar trying with all his hands to keep
the sheet music in front of the cockroach.
As we see the sheet music flutter up and fly
around, we see a bead of sweat drip down
the caterpillar’s brow...”

Another improviser came forward at this point to play the caterpillar.
PLAYER 6: “...and we cut away from this scene to a small
house. Sitting on a chair next to a table is
a small, sad-looking girl with blonde hair
swooped down all the way to the floor...”

An improviser stepped out as the sad-looking girl.

PLAYER 7: “...all the way down to the floor and in front



of her on the table is a violin that is just ina
horrible state of disrepair. It’s got holes in it and
the holes are covered with tape and patches...”

PLAYER 8: “...And sitting next to her is an older man who is
balding and who has a fat gigantic stomach...”

Again, someone from the back-line stepped forward as the older man.

PLAYER 5: “...He’s wearing a wife-beater that is stained
all over the chest. He has a tattoo that says
USMC on it, and he has a beard.”

PLAYER 7: “...and we cut away from this scene and
we see a sign on a door in downtown
London and it says ‘The Royal Philharmonic
Society’ and the door opens, and we go past
brilliantly dressed gentlemen and we see a
man dressed in a very fine suit with a little
thin mustache...”

As this shot was being described, the ensemble came forward as

the brilliantly dressed gentlemen being described. When Player 7
described the man with the little thin mustache, a member of the
ensemble from the back-line framed one improviser on stage with his
arms, in order to indicate which member of the group was the man
with the little thin mustache.

PLAYER 2: “...a little thin mustache that extends out
across his face, and his hair is very slicked
back and greasy, and standing next to him
is a little girl with black ponytails that stick
almost straight up from her head...”

Again, an improviser from the back-line came forward to play the girl
with the black ponytails.

PLAYER 4: “...she’s holding a violin but she has turned
it upside down. Suddenly the music swells
and we see fairylike dust appear across the
screen as the tile begins to appear...”



This group did a great job of setting up a clear genre in their opening.
The moment this was labeled as an animated movie, we didn’t need
many clues in order to identify the genre. All of the players got on
the same page about adding visuals and characters that you would
expect to see in a computer-animated children’s movie. Humans and
anthropomorphic insects existing in the same world, the exaggerated
visual appearance of the characters, details like “fairy dust,” and the
slightly corny title all support this genre.
In this opening, the players successfully set up the three opening
scenes for their Movie. Each character is given some attributes through
description, but the exact relationships between the characters are only
hinted at. This group does a good job of using familiar archetypes from
animated movies for kids: the “lead bug” has grand aspirations, he has
a bumbling sidekick, and details like the thin moustache and greasy,
slicked-back hair suggest that the gentleman in the third section is
villain material.
Asssscat
Asssscat is a made-up word that the Upright Citizens Brigade came up
with for the free show that they started after moving to New York City.
It is also a longform structure performed by six to nine improvisers
in which the scenes are based on information culled from improvised
personal monologues. The structure of Asssscat is intentionally very
simple, the idea being that any skilled Long Form improviser could sit
in and play at any given Asssscat.
An Asssscat begins by taking a suggestion from the audience.
This suggestion inspires an initial monologue. The monologues can
be provided by a guest performer or by one of the members of the
ensemble. The monologist should not participate in scene work.
Anyone capable of telling a detailed true story or anecdote could serve
as a monologist for an Asssscat. In order to provide information for
three to four scenes, an Asssscat monologue should generally be three
to five minutes long. 9:.+&)&+%*#%!&.2&".!&’.&/%$#*%+&4.2.$.-;%(3&1$%)(%&
Following the initial monologue, the ensemble will perform three to
four different longform scenes, each inspired by details, premises, and
ideas generated by the monologue.

When someone in the ensemble feels that the information in the
initial monologue has been exhausted, they will cue the monologist to
deliver a second monologue. This second monologue can follow up on
the first, be inspired by the initial suggestion in a different way, or be
inspired by something that happened in one of the scenes. When you
start to run out of information from the second monologue, you want to
look for your ending. You should try to end your show on a high point 9)&
(’+.2-&0)$$8)0>&’.&)2.’"%+&(0%2%3&)2&%(1%0#)$$,&5;22,&$#2%3&%’06=. Please realize
that if there is a paucity of information in the first or second monologue,
you may require a third monologue to inspire further scenes.
Asssscat scenes tend to be premise-based, since comedic premises
are relatively easy to identify and pull from monologues. As in all
longforms, the improvisers in an Asssscat also have the option of
starting scenes with a detail or a half-idea from the monologue.
However, starting with a strong premise is generally the preferred style
of play in an Asssscat show. (For a review on initiating scenes from
monologues, please return to pg 247.)
The simplicity of the Asssscat form makes it seem very appealing to
new performers. It is important to realize that in other forms such as
the Harold or the Movie, the audience will be impressed by callbacks
and connections. The structures of those forms make them feel like a
cohesive whole. While Asssscats can be very entertaining, they are only
as good as each performer’s individual scene work. You can’t depend on
the Asssscat form to elevate your scene work to a higher level.
Monoscene
The Monoscene is a longform that was perfected by The Swarm, a
house-team from UCBTNY. It is comprised of one long, continuous
scene with no time dashes. Monoscenes should be of comparable

length to a Harold or any other longform structure, meaning that this
single scene will be sustained for about 25 to 30 minutes.
Like most longforms, The Monoscene is best performed by a group
of six to nine improvisers. The structure of the Monoscene is, on the
surface, very simple. The entire show will feature one location and
uses no edits of any kind. Monoscenes do not include an opening.
They begin with the ensemble taking an audience suggestion that
directly inspires some members of the ensemble to establish a location
and activity. A Monoscene can start with two improvisers, multiple
improvisers, or the entire ensemble. The scene will unfold in this
single location without jumping forward or backward through time.
While this initial scene is technically never edited, the members of the
ensemble can use entrances and exits to essentially split up the show
into shorter “scenes.” Within this single location, each improviser will
establish a character that they will likely play for the duration of the
show. However it is possible for one improviser to use entrances and
exits to play multiple characters. The more improvisers there are in
your ensemble, the less necessary it will be for any improviser to play
multiple characters. As with any longform, ensembles performing the
Monoscene will look to find and play games. The Monoscene differs
from most scenes in that you will intentionally find multiple games
within a single scene. A good Monoscene will end with a callback,
connection, or heightened game move.
As is the case with any scene, Monoscenes are more likely to succeed
if improvisers establish a clear and simple base reality from the start.
Monoscenes typically start with the establishment of a location.
A good Monoscene location will be a place where we are likely to see
multiple characters 9%6-6&)2&.?0%&8+%)>&+..43&)2&)#+1.+’&’%+4#2)$3&)&
You must also give yourself a strong What within this environment
(e.g. “celebrating someone’s birthday in the office break room,” “being
delayed due to weather in the airport,” or “meeting someone’s new
girlfriend at the dinner party”). Why are these characters together?
What are they doing? Giving your Monoscene a strong What makes
all the games seem like they are part of one scene. The What of your
Monoscene also gives you something to return to as you and your
teammates look for the next game move.
Once you have your What and your Where, you can begin to make
character choices. You can either establish a character choice for
yourself or look to give gifts to your scene partners in order to help
them find characters. 9@"%&)11+.)0"&,.;&;(%&0.;$/&8%&1+%/%’%+4#2%/&#2&
+%"%)+()$(&.+&1+#.+&’.&1%+5.+4)20%6=&Since you could be playing this single
character for up to thirty minutes, it is important to make choices that
create a grounded three-dimensional character. You want to avoid
making “broad” or “big” choices that will quickly become tiresome.
Silly or absurd choices can be hard to sustain over a thirty-minute

longform. By establishing a strong point of view, you will make it easier
for yourself to continually answer the questions, “What would my
character say?” and “What would my character do?”
Game is an essential element for a successful Monoscene. As
previously stated, your ensemble will intentionally find multiple games
within a single scene.
You should think of each individual character as having his or her
own game. For this reason, no one in a Monoscene will intentionally
play a neutral voice of reason. Each character should have an interesting
behavior or point of view that can be heightened and explored
throughout the show. For example, let’s imagine the Monoscene
involving the birthday party in an office break room. You are playing a
boss. In the first few minutes of the scene, you over-share about your
weekend at home. This behavior can be followed as a character game for
the rest of the show. In every situation and conversation that follows, the
boss should look to over-share some more.
While every character will have a game, it is not possible to establish
two different character games simultaneously.
You will need to use give and take. While an improviser is making
choices that will lead to their character game, the other improviser or
improvisers in the scene with them at that time will remain relatively
neutral. Once this improviser has established their character game,
they will pull back and remain relatively neutral, allowing another
improviser to establish their game. The ensemble will give and take
in this manner until all of the improvisers have established individual
character games.
Give and take is also important for playing game as the Monoscene
progresses. Even though no character should be neutral, every
character will at times play the voice of reason to someone else.
Let’s return to our break room birthday party and imagine another
character: a temp who is trying too hard to impress everyone so that
they will be hired as a full-time employee. Our boss could act as a
voice of reason to this character, even though they has an established
game 9.*%+A(")+#2-&1%+(.2)$&#25.+4)’#.2=. When these two characters
are together, the improviser playing the boss may rest the game of
over-sharing in order to react to, question, and challenge the temp’s
game of “trying too hard.” Conversely, we could see an interaction
wherein the temp rests their game and plays the voice of reason to the
boss’s over-sharing.
Finally, Monoscenes will sometimes have one or more “macro-
games” that can be played throughout the show. Often, these games
will be tied to the circumstances of the What and the Where. In our
office birthday party example, a recurring macro-game could be that
everyone has brought terrible, clearly last-minute gifts to the party&9)&

Entrances and exits in a Monoscene serve the same purpose that
edits do in other longforms: helping with game play, pacing, and give &
take. If you start with two improvisers, the rest of the ensemble should
look to take turns entering the scene to establish their characters. You
don’t want to wait too long to introduce a new character. Looking for
an exit once you have introduced your own character will allow one
of your teammates to introduce their own character. If you start with
the entire ensemble on stage, you will find that exiting will give other
improvisers on stage a chance to establish their character games. Once
you have clearly established your game, it is a good idea to exit the
scene so that you leave the audience wanting more, thereby setting
you up to return to your character and game later in the show. Having
your character exit early on in the Monoscene has the same effect of a
well-timed edit in the first beat of a Harold. It gets you offstage before
you burn out your game, and gives you something to come back to
later in the longform. Once everyone has established their character
game, frequent entrances and exits can help you shift focus among the
different games of the Monoscene.
While entrances and exits can be very helpful, they are not required
in a Monoscene. It is possible to perform a successful Monoscene
with the entire ensemble on stage for the duration of the show. In
this situation, the ensemble should be looking to give and take focus
verbally such that the scene is easy to follow, and such that the different
games can be discovered, heightened, and explored.
As with all longforms, you want to end your Monoscene on a high
note. Once you’ve passed the twenty or twenty-five minute mark, you
should look to make a callback to something that happened earlier,
whether you return to something you said or did, or you make a
reference to something someone else said or did. It is also possible to
set someone else up to make a callback to something from their game.
Monoscenes differ from other longforms in that ending them on
a plot point can be satisfying. A strategy that some ensembles use
when performing a Monoscene is to hint at some significant future
event early on in the show. The ensemble will then actively look to
show that event by the end of the performance. Doing so can give the
audience the sense that the entire show was building to this point. The
plot that gets you there should not be your focus. Think of ending with
this “payoff” as a sort of callback. You are simply returning to an idea
established early on in the piece. For example, in the office birthday
party, we could be anticipating the arrival of a party clown.
Ending with a callback or a “payoff” is not an absolute requirement.
Simply ending with another heightened game move can be enough to
get you out of a Monoscene.
While their structures are obviously very different, you can draw
parallels between a successful Monoscene and a successful Harold.
Ideally, your Monoscene will start off with very disparate games (in

this case, the games are tied to the different characters). Individual
games in a Monoscene will be returned to in the same way that games
from the first beat of a Harold are revisited in the second beat. The
obvious difference is that there is no set order in which you will return
to the games of a Monoscene. Exiting and returning to a game later
in a Monoscene is equivalent to a time dash second beat in a Harold.
Finally, just like in a Harold, you should end your Monoscene with a
strong callback.
The Monoscene is a great structure to focus on if your ensemble is
interested in exploring character work.
Deconstruction
The Deconstruction is a longform that starts with a long, detailed,
information-generating opening scene inspired by an audience
suggestion. The name Deconstruction stems from the fact that this
opening scene will be broken apart, its “pieces” used as the starting
point for the other scenes. This opening scene serves as the opening for
the piece, providing all of the information and ideas to inspire the rest
of the scenes.
The first scene of a Deconstruction is normally a two-person scene
that tends to be much longer than the average two-person scene. The
performers in the scene should feel free to take their time, and the
rest of the ensemble can be patient with editing the scene. The two
improvisers performing this scene should look to establish strong
characters, a clear relationship between these characters, and lots of
information, opinions, and details about the world surrounding them.
The improvisers on the back-line will be gathering this information
from the opening scene to inspire later scenes.
Since this first scene will be the source of inspiration for all of the
following scenes, filling it with details and information is extremely
important. Whereas you normally stop Yes Anding once you have
found a first unusual thing and switch to If Then to play a game, in
the opening scene of a Deconstruction, you will continue to Yes And
past any unusual things that arise so that you can generate more
information. Remember, this is an opening, so the ensemble should
note these unusual things such that they can be used later as premises
and half-ideas to start scenes. Instead of narrowing the focus of the
scene by asking, “If this is true, then what else is true?” you should
keep expanding, adding, and building in new information. Throwing
in new observations, character beliefs, and other details will give you

more ideas to choose from when starting new scenes. In other words,
the opening scene of a Deconstruction can be less game-focused and
more like a meandering conversation.
In addition to continuing to Yes And after the discovery of unusual
things, two other rules of good scene work can be broken in the
opening scene of a Deconstruction. You will talk about characters
that are not there so that these characters can appear in later scenes.
Although you normally want to avoid talking about the past or the
future, in an opening Deconstruction scene, doing so can provide
useful information for later scenes. All of the other rules of good Long
Form scene work apply to the opening scene of a Deconstruction
(listening, playing at the top of your intelligence, starting in the
middle, establishing a clear and specific relationship, etc.).
Since we are not following the rule of finding a game after
something unusual arises, the opening scene of a Deconstruction
is not going to be as focused and funny as a scene built around a
game. Whereas these scenes do not have to be deathly serious,
they will generally be closer in tone to a short play than a comedy
sketch. You don’t have to be concerned over the number of laughs
you are getting in the opening scene, since your primary goal is
generating information.
The rest of the form is like an Asssscat in that there is no set
structure following the opening scene. All scenes that follow should
be inspired by something that happened in the opening scene.
These scenes will follow all the rules of Long Form comedy scene
work. The improvisers should initiate ideas clearly, look for the first
unusual thing, and make patterns of absurd or unusual behavior. The
ensemble will edit all of the rest of the scenes in the piece normally.
There are two types of scenes in a Deconstruction: main character
scenes and tangent scenes. Main character scenes are either time
dash scenes involving one or both of the characters from the opening
scene, or scenes in which one or both of the characters from the
opening scene are referenced. In Time Dash main character scenes,
you should try to put the main characters into new and different
situations that will help you explore them further. Since we are
deconstructing the two main characters, we may also see scenes that
explore “personality-forming events” in their life. These scenes show
the audience how the characters became who they are and why they
are unique to the Deconstruction.
Scenes that do not include one of the two original characters are
called tangent scenes. Tangent scenes can be initiated with premises
or half-ideas that are analogous to funny ideas discovered in the
opening scene. The second scene of the Deconstruction must be a
tangent scene that has nothing to do with the two main characters.
This helps you avoid any expectations from your audience that the
show will be a sort of play about the two main characters. This will

also ensure that the audience is not thrown when tangent scenes show
up later in the longform.
Like most longforms, the Deconstruction should end on a callback
or a high point of some sort. It is possible to end the show with one or
both of the initial characters, but it is not mandatory that you do so.
Let’s take a look at some examples from a Deconstruction performed
by Reuben Williams, one of the UCBTNY house teams:
The first scene of the Deconstruction featured two older women,
Carol and Charlene, who had gotten together to do some gardening
over the weekend. The first information generated in the scene
revolved around the fact that Charlene had recently spent some
time in the hospital. It was established that Charlene was somewhat
obsessed with mentioning her hospital stay—she constantly qualified
whatever she was doing by describing it as the first time that she had
done that thing since coming home from the hospital.
Other information generated in this scene included the following:
Charlene expressed her frustration at her inability to stop her VCR
from blinking 12:00 AM, in spite of her son’s instructions on how
to solve this problem. It was revealed that Charlene’s injury and
subsequent hospital stay were the result of falling off of a stationary
motorcycle. Charlene also received a few text messages from her
grandson. We found out that Carol was a librarian, and she talked
about the recent rise in people stealing books from her library.
Carol also mentioned that her husband had been in Cuba for weeks
on business. Some of the information generated in this scene are
premises and some are half-ideas. Reuben Williams used the ideas in
scenes as follows:
The second scene of the Deconstruction was a tangent scene
inspired by the fact that books were being stolen from Carol’s library.
The scene started with the premise of a “gang” who stole books from
a library instead of borrowing them for free. The game of the scene
ended up being that there was a gang that only stole “free stuff.”
Through support moves, we saw the gang terrorize a city by stealing
pamphlets, McDonald’s napkins, copies of the Onion, etc.
The third scene showed a main character scene that was inspired
by Charlene’s text messages from her grandson. The game of the scene
involved the grandson obsessively text messaging his grandmother
instead of paying attention to his date.
From this point on, the scenes alternated between tangent scenes
and main character scenes. These included (among others) a tangent
scene about old people taking a class on “modern technology” (e.g.
setting your VCR and recording answering machine messages) and
a main character scene in which Charlene, on the stand as a witness
in a murder trial, frustrated the judge by constantly referencing her
hospital stay.

The Check-In is a variation on the Deconstruction. In the opening for
the Check-In, one of the improvisers reenacts the most significant
events of a particularly interesting day that he or she actually
experienced. The performer reenacts these events through scenes in
which we only hear their side of the dialogue. The opening should be as
long and detailed as the opening scene for a standard Deconstruction.
Ensembles should pick someone who has recently had an interesting
day to perform the opening for the Check-In 9%6-63&C’"%&/),&4,&(#(’%+&
8)0>%/&.;’&.5&"%+&!%//#2-3F&C’"%&/),&7&-.’&)++%(’%/3F&%’06=6&It is important
that the improviser performing the opening does not share any of the
details of their interesting day with anyone else in the ensemble before
the show.
During the opening of the Check-In, you are not telling the story
of your day, but rather acting it out. Since the dialogue is going to be
one-sided, you will need to fill in the other side of the conversation
through repetition. For example, in real life you might have just said,
“Yes,” if someone asked to sit next to you. In the opening of the Check-
In, you would say something like, “Excuse me? Yeah, you can sit here.”
Furthermore, when the audience needs to know what your inner
thoughts or feelings were, you will need to “muse out loud” to yourself.
For example, if part of the experience that you want to get across is that
you met someone with a giant scar across their face that made you very
uncomfortable, you might muse to yourself, “Whoa…look at that giant
scar…no-no-no please don’t come over to me…okay he’s coming to talk
to me,” before breaking into your actual dialogue with the person: “—
Hey! How are you doing?”
Let's take a look at an abbreviated example of an opening for the
Check-In. 9@"%&%$$#1(%(&(#-2#5,&1);(%(&’")’&’"%&1%+5.+4%+&!.;$/&’)>%&#2&.+/%+&

what that has to do with...So you think that Twinkies and cupcakes
are evil?...It's an interesting theory, but I still don't agree with you.

me?...Well, I guess I do look a lot fatter in that picture. I lost a lot of
weight...I promise you, that's me!”

(Note: This is a lot shorter than the opening for a Check-In would
typically be.)

The Check-In is similar to the Deconstruction in that the
performers will deconstruct the one-sided dialogue for scene ideas,
just as performers mine ideas from the opening scene of a standard

It is different from the Deconstruction in that 95% of the scenes of
the Check-In will be tangent scenes. Remember, these are initiated with
premises and half-ideas that are analogous to funny ideas discovered
in the opening. Main character scenes are, for the most part, avoided
to ensure that you don’t merely reenact what the audience has already
seen in the opening. Focusing on tangent scenes will also keep you
from limiting one performer to only playing the role of the main
character from the opening.

Here are a few sample premises that could be pulled from our
truncated Check-In Opening:

¢ Acupcake factory that is run by Satan. This is inspired by the cab driver's
claim that the snack food aisle in the supermarket is evil.

« Aguytries to get out of a speeding ticket with a cop by claiming that he
was in a hurry because he was starving. This is inspired by the moment in
the Check-In when the performer says, “Please step on it, I’m starving.”
“Please step on it” is a phrase that normally implies an emergency of
some sort.

¢ Abartender checks the ID of a patron. Thinking the picture looks nothing
like the patron and that the ID is a fake, he brutally insults the picture. This
is inspired by the airport attendant from the opening.

There is no set structure to the Check-In beyond the opening. The
ensemble will essentially perform a montage of scenes using ideas
from the opening as inspiration. As in all longforms, you should be
looking to vary your scenes between two-person and group scenes, and
you should be looking to make callbacks and connections.

If your ensemble spends a lot of time together or you have lives
that are very similar (e.g. you are all struggling actors), you may have to
regularly elect one of the members of your group to go out and consciously
have an interesting day (do something that you don’t normally do) in order
to avoid having repetitive shows.



The longforms described here are only a handful of those in existence.
Even more are sure to be created by new and inventive performance
groups. New ensembles should give themselves the freedom to try
out many different forms until they find the one that best suits their
strengths and weaknesses. Or you can use the basic components of the
pre-existing longforms to create something new that works for you.
At first, learning the structure and rules of a longform is going
to make improvising more difficult than just doing isolated scenes.
However, stick with it. Eventually, with practice, the structure will
become second nature. Learning a structure will be worth it, since good
scene work within a structure is always going to be more impressive
than good scene work alone.

SECTION THREE * CHAPTER THIRTEEN

Rehearsal &
Performance

Please remember what was said at

the very beginning of this book: “Just
reading this book alone will not make
you a great improviser. You will also
need constant practice and performance.
As with any other art form, you will not
become a competent improviser by just
reading about how to do it. Experience
will be your best teacher, so you must
find the time to practice and perform as
much as possible.”

It would take at least one to two years in classes to cover
everything in this book, so don’t expect to master it after
one read. The only way to master Long Form is to practice.

So in this chapter we give advice on how to practice
improv. We also get into a few of the mechanics of putting
on animprov show.

Topics covered:

¢ Theimportance of rehearsal

« Warm-up exercises

¢ Hanging out outside of rehearsal

« Chemistry

¢ Theimportance of coaches and directors
« Showmanship and Stagecraft

¢ When to Perform?

Rehearsal
It may seem odd to talk about rehearsal for an art form that is all about
spontaneity and creating things in the moment. However, all great Long
Form ensembles will undoubtedly attribute their success to the long
hours they put into rehearsing.
Rehearsing is crucial to becoming amazing at Long Form improv.
For many new improvisers, the only practice they get is at their
weekly three-hour class. If you are really serious about becoming
a great improviser, this is not nearly enough. The more time you
devote to working on fundamentals, the better you will become as an
individual performer. Set rehearsals are essential for working on the
fundamentals of improv. The more you work on the fundamentals
described in this book, the easier they will come to you when you need
them most—on stage, in front of an audience.
The simplest way to ensure success with rehearsals is to approach
them with consistency. Make rehearsal with your team a priority.
Rehearsal isn’t only about the time you put in; it’s also about the
effort you put forth and how you utilize this time. Do you have specific
short-term and long-term goals that you hope to achieve through
rehearsal? Are you taking your rehearsal time seriously? Is your energy
level in rehearsal where it would need to be in a performance situation?
This last question is extremely important. Even though you might be in
a basement studio space or somebody’s apartment, you need to resist
the impulse to be casual or uncommitted.
A typical rehearsal should start with a few warm-ups. A warm-up is a
short exercise your ensemble will do to establish group mind and/or
to get their energy up. Different warm-ups serve different functions
and exercise different skills. All warm-ups can be put in one of two
categories: energy or mental. A good energy warm-up should “wake
you up” and get your energy up to performance level. Energy warm-
ups also have the added benefit of helping you get out of your head and
shed your inhibitions prior to rehearsal. Mental warm-ups are designed
to get you thinking in terms of patterns and specifics. Good mental
warm-ups will have you finding and continuing patterns as a group.
Every rehearsal should start with at least one energy warm-up and at
least one mental warm-up.

Energy Warm-Up Examples

The following are recommended energy warm-ups and descriptions of
how they are played.

WARM-UP: CRAZY 8s

INSTRUCTIONS

Your ensemble should form a circle.

Everyone should loudly count to eight in unison. It is important
to be very high-energy and committed.

As you count to eight, everyone should also be shaking out
their left hands and making eye contact with each other. (This
movement should be reminiscent of “the Hokey Pokey.”)

Everyone should then count to eight while shaking out their right
hands, then their left legs, and then their right legs to finish.

At this point, your ensemble will start over by shaking out their
left hands, this time counting to seven in unison.

Continue to count to seven while shaking out each appendage in
the same order.


Continue this pattern for six, five, four, etc., until you get to “one.’

After you’ve counted out “one,” everyone should let out a yell
and go crazy.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

WARM-UP: ENEMY,
PROTECTOR

INSTRUCTIONS
Your entire ensemble should take the stage.

Without verbally or physically indicating so, each member of the
ensemble should choose someone else to be their “enemy.”

Next, each member of the ensemble should choose someone
else to be their protector. (Again, do not indicate your choice with
words or actions.)

The group should count down from three in unison.

After you get to one, everyone should begin quickly moving
around the space with the shared goal of getting your protector
between you and your enemy.

Since everyone is moving to get into position at the same time,
the ensemble will be constantly moving around the space.



WARM-UP: CLAP/MOVE/SING

INSTRUCTIONS
Your ensemble should form a circle.

One member of the ensemble will begin the warm-up by
facing the person to their immediate right.

These two improvisers should then clap together once at the
same time.

The second improviser should then face the person to their
immediate right.

Now these two improvisers should clap together once at the
same time.

The clap should continue to be “passed” this way around
the circle.

When clapping, your goal should be synchronization, not
speed. Make eye contact and try your best to clap at exactly the
same time once, such that you only hear one clap.

At any point, someone may pass the clap back in the
direction it just came from. The clap should then continue in
this new direction.

After about a minute, someone in the ensemble will break out
of the circle and begin moving around the space.

The rest of the ensemble should follow so that everyone is
moving around the space.

As you move around the space, you should continue to pass
the clap. Making eye contact will be key for successfully
clapping at the same time as your partner.

After another minute passes, someone in the ensemble should
begin singing one of their favorite songs.

The rest of the ensemble should join in as they continue to
move around the space and pass the clap from improviser
to improviser.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

WARM-UP: FOLLOW THE
FOLLOWER

This exercise can also serve as an effective warm-up.
For instructions, please refer back to page 259.

Mental Warm-Up Examples

The following are recommended mental warm-ups
with instructions.

WARM-UP: COUNT TO TWENTY

INSTRUCTIONS
Your ensemble should form a huddle.
Everyone should close their eyes.

With only one improviser saying one number at a time, the group
should start counting to twenty.

If, at any point, two improvisers say the next number in the
sequence at the same time, everyone must start over again
at one.

The game will end only once your team has counted to twenty
without any two teammates speaking at the same time.

In order to achieve this simple task, your ensemble must take
their time, and give and take.



WARM-UP: POINTIES

INSTRUCTIONS
Your ensemble should form a circle.
Everyone should raise their right hand above their head.

One member of the ensemble will point at someone else and say the
first word in a category they have in mind. (At this point, the category
will be unclear. Even though the improviser has category in mind, that
category will not necessarily play out.) For example, a member of the
ensemble might point to someone else and say, “orange.”

Throughout the exercise, once you say a word, you put your hand down.

The person who was pointed to will point to someone else and say a
new word. Their goal should be to add another word to the category
that they believe the first improviser had in mind. In response to
“orange,” they might say “purple” if they think the category is colors,
or “banana” if they think the category is “fruits.”

The second person who was pointed to should lock the category by
pointing to someone else and saying a third word in the category. For
example, if the first word was “orange,” the second word was “purple,”
and the third word is “green,” the category of “colors” has been locked.

New words should be added until everyone has gone. The final person
to add to the pattern should point to the person who started. Now we
have established Category 1.

Now this pattern of words (Category 1) can be repeated as a circuit,
meaning that everyone will point to the same person and say the same
word. Cycle through Category 1 a few times.

Next, everyone raises their right hands again to begin a brand new
category. A different person will start a second category. This time
around, each person should try their best to point to someone new.
Once Category 2 is completed, cycle through it a few times.

This process should then be repeated a third time.
Now you can use this warm-up to test your ensemble’s memory.

Start over with Category 1, repeating the same words in the same order
to the same people. Slowly, your ensemble should incorporate the
second and third categories such that all three categories are being
passed around the circle at the same time.

You will need to be alert and ready to continue each category when you
are called upon to do so.

You may need to repeat your word or say it louder if someone does not
respond, in order to keep that category alive.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

WARM-UP: 7 THINGS

INSTRUCTIONS
¢ Your ensemble should form a circle.

* One member of the ensemble will name a category and then
choose someone else to name seven items in this specific
category. The category should not be totally obscure, but
something that can be reasonably answered. (“Famous painters”
would be a good category, while “professional lacrosse players”
would be too obscure.)

¢ The ensemble will count off and clap once per item named.

¢ Once you reach seven, the ensemble should chant, “These are
seven things!” loudly, in unison, while punching the air.

* The person who just named seven items will choose a new
category and assign it to another improviser.

* You must name seven items, whether you know seven “real”
items that fit the category or not. If you know real items, use
those first. It is always better to remember than to invent. If you
do not know real items, or if you run out at some point, you must
do your best to offer plausible sounding items.

¢ Example: You are given the category of medicines. You name
“Lipitor,” “Zoloft,” and “Claritin” before you run out. You should
then give plausible-sounding items such as “Rejuvinor.” Don’t say
fake, jokey-sounding items such as “Happy Pills.”

« Repeat this process until everyone has named seven things.



WARM-UP: BA DA DA

INSTRUCTIONS

Your ensemble should form a circle.

Start by patting a steady rhythm on your thighs.

You will work to build “compound words” together in pairs.

Someone starts by saying the first half of the compound word
(e.g. “shoe”).

The person standing to their immediate right says the second
half of the compound word (e.g. “horn”).

The entire ensemble then says the newly formed compound
word, followed by the nonsense phrase “ba da da” in unison
(e.g. “shoe-horn, ba da da”).

Everything said should be in sync with the rhythm you are
patting on your thighs.

After the person completes a compound word, they will offer up
the first half of the next compound word.

You should aspire to create compound words that make sense,
such as “shoe-horn.” However, more important than making
sense is staying on the rhythm. If a real compound word does
not come to you, you can make up nonsense words such as
“shoe-moon,” as long as you stay on the rhythm.

WARM-UP: ONE-WORD
PATTERN GAME

¢ This opening can also serve as an effective mental warm-up.
For instructions, please refer back to page 226.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

WARM-UP: MIND MELD

INSTRUCTIONS
¢ Your ensemble should form a circle.
* Two improvisers volunteer to begin.

¢ They count to three and then say two different words

e Example: Improviser 1 says, “dog,” and Improviser 2 says,

¢ The entire ensemble will look for a word “in between” these
words. Another way to think of this is to find a word that both
of the initial words have in common.

¢ Once an improviser thinks they have the “definitive connecting
word,” they should raise their hand.

¢ The first two improvisers to raise their hands will count to three
and then say their connecting words simultaneously.

* Let’s says that the next two improvisers guess “walk” and

¢ The ensemble’s goal is now to find the common word for these
two new words.

* Thesame word cannot be guessed in two consecutive rounds.

* The ensemble continues this process until two improvisers say
the same word simultaneously. For instance, after “walk” and
“curb,” two improvisers might say the word “leash,” at which
point the exercise would be complete.

Note: You do not have to say single words only. Terms that
represent one thought, such as “ice cream cake” or “wedding
reception,” are acceptable.

ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE

e Round 2: Liquid & oil spill
e Round 3: Ocean & Katrina

e Round 4: Hurricane



The benefit of rehearsal is that it will “get you out of your head.” There
are a lot of rules, guidelines, and theories that you are introduced to
when you begin studying Long Form improv. If you are thinking about
these rules, guidelines, and theories while performing, then you are
bound to get stuck in your head. Being in your head is not optimal
because if you are thinking of the rules, you can’t fully listen to your
scene partner.
While it is not optimal, being in your head in this way is inevitable
at the beginning of the learning process, and is ultimately beneficial.
Thinking about the rules means that you are consciously trying to
follow them. With time, following the rules will become second nature,
and you will no longer have to consciously think about them.
The most worthless version of being in your head is worrying about
“being funny.” When you are in your head in this way, purposefully shift
your attention to the rules, guidelines, and theories. You will still be in
your head, but in a way that will ultimately benefit you.

Being able to adhere to the rules, guidelines, and theories without
consciously thinking about them is called being in the moment.
Achieving this state is the primary goal of rehearsal. There is no magic
shortcut to being in the moment. A performer’s ability to do so comes
as a result of lots of practice.
The concepts and rules that one person finds “easy” or “difficult” will
vary wildly between any two improvisers. It is important that you do
not allow those rules and concepts that you find difficult to overwhelm
you. If you are struggling with many different concepts (which is bound
to happen to you at some point), don’t try to fix everything at once.
Take each concept on one at a time. Let’s say that listening is just one
of many problems that you are struggling with. Focus on just that for a
few rehearsals or shows. Once you feel that you’ve made some progress
with listening, you can start focusing on something else you need to
work on, such as pushing yourself to do more object work. If you try to
fix everything at once, you will end up fixing nothing.
Let’s revisit our earlier analogy of learning to ride a bike. You learn
to ride over a period of time; the various skills and movements involved
eventually becoming second nature to you. But if you remember back
to the start of that process, it was probably very hard. When you first
started riding a bike, you had to remember a lot of rules at once: keep
balanced, keep pedaling, remember to steer, etc. Through constant
practice and repetition, you eventually learned to follow all these rules
without thinking about any of them. Following the rules has become
“automatic,” allowing you to just have fun riding the bike.
The same thing happens with Long Form. You will feel the same
sort of struggle that you felt when learning to ride a bike. However,
once you’ve put in the time, you should also find yourself thinking
about each of these individual rules less and less. You will be “in the
moment,” allowing yourself to truly be present on stage with your
fellow improvisers.
The transition from being in your head to being in the moment is
not easy or predictable. In the early stages, the rules of improv will
often seem to be making your improv worse. This is because you do not
yet “own the rules.” The time it takes for the rules of improv to become
second nature will be different for every improviser. Learning the rules
of improv isn’t like checking items off of a list. There will be some rules
that you will improve upon and then have to return to again. Some you
will own the rules from the first time you are introduced to them. There
are some that you may think you will never understand until suddenly
you do. Keep working hard and putting in the time, and eventually you
will own all of the rules and be able to be in the moment.

In addition to your development as an individual player, rehearsal
is also about developing ensemble or group mind. Long Form
improvisation is a team activity. You can draw comparisons between
improv rehearsal and practicing together as a sports team. How good
would an NBA team be if they never practiced? Most professional sports
teams work so well together because they practice with each other
almost every day of the week.
It is crucial that all members of the group (or as many as possible)
attend rehearsals. If you are constantly missing members, it will be
very hard to develop group mind. Rehearsing is the simplest thing that
you can do to become a great Long Form group. Meeting once a week
for three hours is the bare minimum commitment to be expected from
people calling themselves a Long Form group. For a group to get very
good, they would need to rehearse a minimum of three times a week.
While this might seem like a big time commitment, remember that for
actors rehearsing a play, meeting every day of the week is the norm.
The more you rehearse, the better your ensemble will become.
Rehearsal allows you and your group to get on the same page in
terms of the structure of your show. Structural elements that can be
decided upon in rehearsal include openings, editing techniques, and
approaches to initiating.
Rehearsal is also where you will discover your ensemble’s style. Are
you a team who plays at a faster or slower pace? Are you especially
adept at physicality, or are you more verbal? Do you keep the entire
ensemble involved at all times through scene painting, sound effects,
background work, etc.? Or perhaps characters are your ensemble’s

strength. Once you discover your style in rehearsal, you will know
what strengths you can rely on in performance.
Rehearsal will allow individual players to discover their roles in
the group. You will discover the aspects of Long Form at which you
individually excel. Every member of the group doesn’t have to be
masterful at every single skill mentioned in this book. A great Long
Form group is comprised of people who know when and where
they need to step up, and when and where they can rely on others
in performance.
Rehearsal allows you to establish the trust in each other that
you need in order to step out on stage in front of an audience with
absolutely nothing planned in advance. Trust within an ensemble
is what allows you to take the risks and play with the confidence
and fearlessness that will make your performances memorable.
Trust allows you to step out with any idea and know that you will be
supported by everyone else standing on stage.
A team with a strong group mind will seem as if they are reading
each other’s thoughts and anticipating moves before they even happen.
They will never seem to be lost or struggling for what to do next. The
seamlessness of their performance will seem magical to an audience.
In reality, a seemingly effortless performance is the result of all the
hard work an ensemble has put in at rehearsals developing their group
mind. Strong group mind will garner you the ultimate compliment in
Long Form: that your improvisation had to have been scripted.

FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN CHEMISTRY

tis rare that the original cast of a Long Form group will stay the
same for as long as that ensemble is active. Not all members of the
original group will fit or belong forever.

As a group develops, certain players may no longer fit because they
have not evolved in the same manner as the rest of the group. It is
also possible for irreconcilable personal conflicts to arise between
members of the group. In these cases, a member or members
choosing to leave—or being asked to leave—the group is usually the
best scenario for all parties involved. The remaining members of the
group can continue to pursue their goals while giving the improviser
or improvisers who have left an opportunity to join a group for which
they are a better fit. These changes often have nothing to do witha
performer’s competence as an improviser. They are made primarily
with concerns about group dynamics in mind.

Furthermore, a performer who is a perfect fit may choose to leave a
group due to personal or professional reasons.

You will want to replace members of the ensemble who leave with
new improvisers who fit the chemistry of your ensemble.

Personnel changes have the potential to be awkward and challenging
for any Long Form group. However, these changes are necessary.
Along with rehearsal, having the right chemistry is one of the major
keys to success for any Long Form improv ensemble.

COACHES & DIRECTORS

A coach is someone outside of the group who leads all rehearsals.
Although they are not a member of the group, a coach should be another
improviser or someone familiar with how Long Form works. It is their
job to help a group work on the fundamentals of a longform structure
with which the group is already familiar. It is the responsibility of the
group to let the coach know what their specific needs are. (For example,
a group working on the Harold may know that they want to work on
openings and second beats.) A prepared coach comes into rehearsals
with exercises in mind that will help a group achieve its goals. After
working with a group for some time, a coach will shape rehearsals in
order to reinforce good habits and help a group improve in areas of
weakness. If possible, a coach should also attend performances in order
to better know what their group needs to work on.

While it is possible to rehearse without a coach, it is highly
recommended that your group hire one. The main reason for having a
coach is to have an informed and objective source of criticism. Knowing
your weaknesses is essential if you want to get better as a group.



We realize that some readers of this book who are far from New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles, or other bigger cities with improv
communities may have a hard time finding a qualified coach. If you
find yourself in this situation, it is possible to conduct productive
rehearsals by having one member of the ensemble serve as the
coach for a given rehearsal. In order to remain objective, the person
coaching does not improvise during the rehearsal. The improviser
serving as the designated coach should change from rehearsal to
rehearsal, rotating through each member of the ensemble. A coach
from within the ensemble needs to be formally designated and
agreed upon by all members of the ensemble. Having all members
of an ensemble provide feedback during a rehearsal is not a viable
substitute for a coach. That would require people to give notes on the
improv that they were a part of. These notes will often end up feeling
like unsolicited criticism and judgment from a peer, instead of an
objective critique from an outside perspective.
If you are the designated coach, you must remember to act
professionally when critiquing your fellow teammates. Remember to be
objective and keep your feedback focused on the fundamentals of good
improv without injecting your own personal opinions and philosophies.
Present your notes with humility. Don’t overstep your bounds. You
need to constantly remind yourself that you are a part of this team.
You are only giving suggestions to make your team stronger. When you
are giving notes to your teammates, deliver them in the same way you
would like them to be given to you.
If your ensemble wants to perform an existing longform that they
are unfamiliar with, or wish to develop a brand new form, they will

want to hire a director. The director will have input on all elements of a
performance: structure, style, and presentation.

A director is different from a coach who simply helps you hone
fundamentals and address weaknesses within a form with which you
are already familiar. In a coaching situation, the group is basically in
control, since a coach serves the group’s needs. A director, on the other
hand, has far more control. Whereas the coach follows the group’s lead,
a group will follow the director’s lead. Besides directing the group in
the development of a longform, a director should also give feedback on
basic scene work fundamentals, just as a coach would.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

BECOMING A COACH YOURSELF

O nce you are consistently doing good work and feel as though
you have a very strong understanding of the fundamentals, you
may want to start coaching other groups. As stated earlier, a coach’s
primary goal is to address the needs of a group and help them reach
their goals. You will also reinforce good habits and help them to rid
themselves of any bad ones.

It will be your job as coach to run the rehearsal and keep the team on
task. By coming up with an agenda of exercises and a focus for that day’s
rehearsal, you can ensure that rehearsal time is being used efficiently.

Be forewarned that some of the progress your group has made

in rehearsal may go out the window once your group performs in
front of an audience. The team is going to make mistakes and do
things that they maybe wouldn’t do in rehearsal in their attempt to
entertain an audience. You should be mindful of how the change

of environment can effect a team’s performance. Do not become
frustrated and hold it against them. Simply point out the strengths
and weaknesses of the performance, just as you would in rehearsal.
However, if you feel that your group has consciously abandoned the
fundamentals of good scene work in an attempt to get quick laughs
from the audience, you will have to point this out to them.

WHEN COACHING, YOU WANT TO OFFER FEEDBACK IN THREE
MAJOR CATEGORIES:

e Fundamentals of scene work

e Individual tendencies of each performer

e« Group tendencies

While it is important to be honest when delivering notes, there isn’t
any need to be condescending or cruel. Criticism should always be
constructive and provided in the most supportive way possible.

Remember, you are not there to discourage them; you are there to
help them learn from their mistakes.

Each group will need to devote a different amount of time to
rehearsing and developing as an ensemble before they are ready to
perform in front of an audience. How long it will take for your group
depends on the level of talent and experience you have, as well as your
goals as a group. Taking rehearsal and preparation seriously will ensure
that your ensemble becomes the best that it can be.



Once you are ready to perform in front of an audience, you should
do so with a sense of professionalism. You should approach each
performance with respect for your time on stage. Many people take
an overly casual approach towards performing improv because of its
unscripted and playful nature. However, performing Long Form should
be considered a privilege, and getting the chance to perform for an
audience should never be taken for granted. A paying audience that is
watching you perform expects to be entertained. Treating the audience
and your show with respect and professionalism will go a long way
towards entertaining them.
Respecting the scene means always committing to and remaining
within the fiction of the scene. Therefore, when you get cheap laughs
through post-modern commentary, you are disrespecting the scene
and your scene partner. Post-modern commentary breaks from
the established reality of the scene in a way that undermines it and
interferes with the audience’s suspension of disbelief.
-\G;F?@,]8,,, A man with a beard is playing a woman in an improv
scene. His scene partner says, “My, you’re a little hirsute
for a woman.”
In this case, the second improviser has undermined
the reality of the scene by calling attention to the reality
of the performance (e.g. that a man, out of necessity, was
playing a woman).
-\G;F?@,^8,,,A, n improviser is having difficulty maintaining a German
accent. His scene partner says, “Are you sure you’re from
Germany? Your accent sounds fake…”
In this case, the second improviser has undermined
the reality of the scene by calling attention to the
imperfect accent, instead of supporting his scene partner
by committing to the established reality.
-\G;F?@,_8,,,A, n ensemble is doing a group scene in which all of the
characters are huge musical fans, sharing their favorites.
One improviser with little knowledge of musicals is able
to name the title of a musical. Another member of the
ensemble, knowing his limited knowledge of musicals,
asks him to sing a specific song from that musical.

This type of post-modern commentary is referred to
as “pimping.” You are pimping your scene partner when
you ask them to do something that you know will be
difficult or embarrassing.
-\G;F?@,‘8,,,A, n adult male improviser is called on to play a little
girl. Instead of altering his voice and physicality slightly
to commit to the character, the improviser talks and
moves as he always does.
In this case, the improviser is commenting on the
fact that he is a man playing a little girl through a lack
of commitment.
-\G;F?@,a8 An ensemble is performing a scene taking place in a
bar. The ensemble has already successfully found a
game in this scene. One of the improvisers accidentally
walks through a space where the bar had been
established. Another improviser stops the action of the
scene to say, “Oh my God! Did you just see that? He has
the ability to phase through solid objects!”
In this instance, a new unusual thing has been introduced that will
undermine and almost definitely trump the game that was already
being played.
Note that all of these instances of post-modern commentary would
likely elicit laughs from an audience. However, these laughs are cheap
laughs. You want your laughs to come from the content of the scene,
not from commenting on its execution. Actively seeking cheap laughs
from post-modern commentary will ultimately undermine your show
and do more harm than good.
You can also look at “breaking” as a subtle form of post-modern
commentary. Breaking is when an improviser breaks from the
reality of the scene and begins laughing. This will sometimes happen
unavoidably. However, it is unacceptable to pander to the audience
by intentionally laughing at what happens in a scene. When you do
this, you are causing the audience to see you as an improviser who is
amused by what you are doing on stage, instead of allowing them to see
you as a character within the fiction of the scene.
Having respect for the scene you are in is synonymous with having
respect for your teammates. Notice that almost all of the examples
we gave involved one improviser undercutting another. Post-modern
commentary is always a selfish act, getting a laugh for oneself at the
expense of the greater good of the scene. Playing with respect for the
scene is as simple as stepping on stage with only one goal in mind: to
make everyone else standing on stage with you look great.

Stagecraft in improvisation is about being heard and being seen. If
the audience can’t hear or see you, they are going to have a hard time
finding your show funny.
There are a few things to consider in order to make sure that you
and your scene partners can be seen properly on stage. First, avoid
blind spots on the stage from which the audience will not be able to
see you. Second, make sure that the other performers are not blocking
you. Third, make sure that you are at least partially facing out towards
the audience. This is referred to as “cheating out.” You want to remain
turned out towards the audience so that they can see your face. Your
facial expressions are one of your primary tools in comedy. Finally, be
mindful of upstaging your scene partner. When you upstage another
performer, you are standing behind them so that they are forced to turn
their back to the audience to speak to you.
It is also important to be heard on stage. You will need to project.
This means speaking loud enough so that the people in the back row of
the audience can hear you. This is something that the director or coach
will need to be on top of, since rehearsal will get improvisers used to

playing to each other without considering being heard by an audience.
Remember, even if your personal style is dry or understated, or you are
playing a character that is shy or whispering, you still need to be heard.
Something else to consider with regard to being heard is “holding
for laughs.” If you say something that causes the audience to laugh, you
may need to pause before offering your next line. Otherwise, it may be
drowned out by the audience’s laughter. This is a skill that comes with
performance experience only. With enough time on stage, holding for
laughs will become second nature, as will projecting and positioning
yourself on stage so that you can be seen.
You need to step on stage ready to perform. You can’t start cold and find
your groove ten minutes into your longform.
It is very important for you to greet your audience with energy
and enthusiasm. If you are low energy or apathetic, you run the risk
of losing the audience’s attention and respect before you even begin.
Your audience has come out to see a show. Your ensemble should give
off the impression that you all are performing from the moment they
step on stage.
Pre-show warm-ups are the best way to get yourself physically and
mentally ready to perform from the moment you step on stage. Just like
in rehearsal, your ensemble should do one energy warm-up and at least
one mental warm-up.
When you choose warm-ups to do before a show, choose the ones
that your group has the most fun doing. Fun pre-show warm-ups that
get your ensemble laughing together and having a good time can be
very valuable. You want to be in a positive mindset before stepping on
stage. A fun or silly pre-show warm-up can help you do this.

WARM-UP: BEASTIE RAP

INSTRUCTIONS
Your ensemble should form a circle.

One improviser will throw out the first line of a rap (e.g. “I went
to the pet store and | bought a cat!”).

The rest of the improvisers in the circle will respond by
rapping, “DA-da-da-DA-da-DA-da-DA-DA!”

The person to the immediate right of the first person who just
rapped will offer a line in which the last word rhymes.

Example: “It was cold outside so | put on my hat!”

With each new line of the Beastie Rap, try to make the last word
of the line fall on the final beat. The entire ensemble should
attempt to say this word together, emulating the Beastie Boys.

After each new line, the entire ensemble will repeat the “DA-da-

You will continue around the circle in the same direction until
everyone has provided a new line for the rap, creating rhymes
without repeating rhyming words.

If a rhyme is repeated, the ensemble should shout, “Oh!” in
unison and then start over.

Additionally, if you simply run out of rhymes and hesitate
or disrupt the rhythm, the ensemble should shout, “Oh!” in
unison and then start over.

If you make it all the way around the circle, the person who
started the rhyme should add a final rhyme to that rap. The
person to the immediate right will then offer a brand new line

to rhyme off of, beginning an entirely new rap.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN « Rehearsal & Performance

WARM-UP: HOT SPOT

INSTRUCTIONS
Your ensemble should form a circle.
One improviser in the circle shouts out a suggestion.

Someone else will step into the center of the circles and sing an
existing song inspired by the suggestion.

Example: The suggestion is “time.” Someone steps into the
center and sings, “Time is On My Side” by the Rolling Stones.

The improvisers in the circle will take turns tagging out the
person in the middle to sing a new song. Each new song should
be inspired by the last.

Example: After hearing “Time is On My Side,” someone else
might tag in and sing “Rock Around the Clock” by Bill Haley
and the Comets.

You should confidently commit to singing the songs, even if
you are not good at singing.
The improvisers in the circle must support the singer by

tagging them out and taking over. The goal is to never leave
anyone in the center of the circle singing for too long.

Further moves in this example could be “Feels Like the First”
and “Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme.”

The key to having high performance energy for the entire show
is to start by hitting the ground running. If you start with the
right energy, it shouldn’t be hard to maintain it throughout the

entire longform.



INTROS

A strong introduction at the top of your show is a great way to let
your audience know right from the beginning that you have put some
thought into your performance. A good intro tells the audience what
it is they are about to see. Write your intro as though you are speaking
to people who are attending your show for the first time. A good intro
should avoid inside jokes or references to other shows at your theater,
so that you don’t alienate any newcomers. It is also important not to
come off as “too cool for school” in your intro, seeming bored as if
you've done this a million times.

Here is a good sample intro:

“Hello! We are the Upright Citizens Brigade and we are going
to perform a Harold for you tonight. The Harold is a Long
Form improvisational structure created by Del Close in
Chicago. What you are about to see is completely improvised,
and to begin, all we need is a suggestion of a single word.
Everything that you see tonight is going to be inspired by the
suggestion that you provide, and once we get this suggestion
we won’t need any other suggestions from you.”

This introduction has explained the Harold clearly enough so that
someone completely unfamiliar with it can have a sense of what they
are about to see. Because the introduction is clear and concise, it will
start the show with a sense of professionalism.

OUTROS

An outro is a short speech to the audience that follows the end of your
show, given by one member of the ensemble. A strong outro thanks the
audience for coming out and encourages them to come back again. If
your show is one of many performed at a theater, the outro presents a

great opportunity for you to inform your audience about other shows
being performed there.

Here is a typical outro for the UCB Theatre:

“Thank you for coming out to Harold Night! If you enjoyed the
show, please come again and tell your friends. We have other
great shows here at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre
seven nights a week. If you would like any information on
other shows, please visit our website and sign our mailing
list on your way out. Thank you and good night!”



Due to the cabaret atmosphere of most venues hosting improv shows,
drinking is often considered to be part of the experience of performing
improv. In fact, drinking is an activity commonly associated with
comedians in general. In spite of this association, reckless or
irresponsible drinking can have a very negative effect on the quality of
your performances.
Performing sober is another way that you and your ensemble
can show your audience that you respect them. Seeing improvisers
performing in an inebriated state can be a painful experience. By
performing drunk, you are essentially telling your teammates and the
audience that the show means as little to you as playing video golf at a
local bar.
How you choose to dress for each performance is another way
to show respect for your audience. The Upright Citizens Brigade
believes that new, unproven ensembles should dress comparable to
“business casual.” This will lend an air of professionalism to your
show. This suggestion is not an attempt by the UCB to alter or criticize
anyone’s personal style. The UCB believes that putting in some effort
to look presentable will go a long way in making your audience take
you seriously as performers. This is especially important for new
performers whose success will be variable.
If you do choose to dress sloppily or without concern, your shows
had better be amazing. An audience will forgive an ensemble’s sloppy
attire if their work is sharp and funny. However, if your show is subpar
and your appearance is sloppy, the audience may feel disrespected.

They are more likely to assume that your subpar performance was due
to a lack of effort on your part.
Your manner of dress also shouldn’t be distracting in any way. This
applies to anything that is too slovenly, provocative, or likely to draw
attention. You don’t want the audience to be paying more attention to
your ratty shorts, sexy clothing, or hilarious ironic t-shirt than they are
to your scenes.
In a practical sense, it is important that you always dress so that
you are ready to perform. If you are wearing a pair of pants that
you’re afraid of getting dirty on stage, you are going to be preoccupied
thinking about your clothing and not invested in your scenes. If you
are wearing a miniskirt that is liable to show off more than you want in
certain positions, you may be unwilling to make physical choices that
would best serve your scenes. Since you are going to want to be free of
restraint, dress to be active. Dress to play.

Final
Thoughts
writers and performers, Long Form improvisation
remains one of the most rewarding performance experiences they can
have. The connection a Long Form ensemble has with its audience is
truly one of a kind. For many professional comedians, there is simply
nothing else that compares to stepping on stage and creating a piece
of comedy in the moment. This is why you see so many accomplished
comedians returning to their improv roots on any stage that welcomes
them. While becoming a great improviser is no easy task, any Long
Form improviser that you ask will undoubtedly say that the hard work
and time that they have put in to learning the craft was well worth it.
Now that you have read this book, the next step in your pursuit of Long
Form excellence is to see and do as much Long Form improv as possible.
Practice, practice, practice.
It was mentioned in the very beginning of this book that reading it
alone would not make you a great improviser. This book is only useful
if it is read in conjunction with practice and performance. If you have
read this book cover-to-cover without yet putting any of the information
into practice, it is likely that you feel overwhelmed by all the rules and
theories. It is important to realize that Long Form needs to be practiced
for you to truly understand it. Long Form improvisation deserves the

same respect and effort you would give to painting, acting, dancing, or
any other art form. Putting in time watching, practicing, and doing is
the step that no serious improviser can skip, no matter how naturally
talented they may be. Much of the time you put in will be devoted to
drilling the fundamentals, especially learning how to consistently Yes
And and training yourself to play the patterns of If Then.
Constantly drilling the fundamentals so that you can react
subconsciously in the moment will help you become truly comfortable
on stage. The fundamentals, once they become second nature, will be
the blueprint for your comedic genius. Mastering these fundamentals
will allow you to react on stage in a way that both highlights your own
talent and allows you to build successful comedic scenes and longforms
with others.
Thank you so much for reading this manual. We love improv and are
proud to have devoted so many years to performing and teaching it.
We hope the theories and exercises we’ve gone over help you to
enjoy doing improv just like we have. As you get better, you’ll develop
your own exercises, openings, and longforms. We look forward to
seeing all the great improv done by the next generation of performers
and teachers.
