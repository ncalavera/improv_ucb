truthful and committed
you are with your base
reality, the easier it will be

Topics covered:

Listening
a Long Form improv scene with
someone else, there is nothing more important than listening. The
beginning of the scene is built through Yes And, and you cannot Yes And
something if you haven’t heard it. It is important to listen because you
are going to have to agree with and add to what your scene partner has
just said. The last thing said on stage is either going to make your base
reality more detailed and specific, or it will be the first unusual thing,
the start of your game.
The start of the scene, like a basement, needs to be strong enough
to support everything else that will be built upon it. Listening needs to
happen so that you and your scene partner are on the same page about
what 3,&’(of house you are building. If you don’t actively listen at the
beginning of a scene, you may think that you are building a house out of
straw, while your teammate thinks you are building it with bricks.
The goal of the beginning of the scene is to establish a relatable
reality from which an unusual or absurd thing can be recognized.
None of this will be possible if you are not actively listening. A great
improviser is a good listener.

To be able to communicate effectively and build a Long Form scene with
another improviser, you have to learn when to speak and when to listen.
This is called !"#$%&’(%)&*$.
One improviser shouldn’t be doing all of the work in a scene. By giving
and taking focus, you share the burden of discovery and creation. Giving
and taking are equally important. It is important that you stop talking
and !"#$%focus to your scene partner when they want to add to the scene.
It is equally important that you begin speaking and )&*$ focus from them
when you have something to contribute to the scene.
There is nothing more awkward to watch on stage than two
improvisers fighting for focus. An ability to give and take focus is
necessary for good listening.

Commitment
in Long Form
Improvisation. All elements of a scene outside of the game (5/%D>’’.%
?&/)%5D%)1$%2<$’$@ should be grounded in the reality that the performers
have agreed upon. Obviously, this includes your performance. You could
be following all of the rules we have presented and still not draw an
audience into your reality if you do not commit.
In simplest terms, <5==")=$’) is good acting. A Long Form
improviser is expected to invest in the reality of the scene in such a way
that the audience doesn’t see an improviser, but a believable character
on stage. Good actors in movies or television disappear into their roles.
Bad actors “take you out of the movie.” Good acting and commitment
to the choices you make in a scene will help your audience become
engaged in the reality you are creating.
A commitment to the reality of the scene does not mean that every
scene you perform has to take place in our reality. It means that you can
do scenes about vampires, pirates, or truckers in deep space, as long
as you are committing to the specific reality in which we might find
these sorts of characters. You must make choices about how to portray
these characters and then remain consistent with your portrayal of the
characters for the entire scene.
Focusing on commitment will prevent you from forcing an “unusual
thing.” If you commit to your characters and portray them as real
people, it will make it easier for you to recognize the unusual when it
happens organically.
Commitment allows your audience to suspend disbelief and
fully experience a fictional reality. The antithesis of commitment is
($)&<1=$’). Detachment makes the audience aware of the artifice of the
scene, drawing attention to the fact that you are a comedian performing
a scene as opposed to a character within the fictional reality of a scene.
Detachment generally comes in one of two forms: unintentional
detachment and ironic detachment.
!"#"$%"$#&"’()*%$’+,-%"$)is the result of improvisers making
choices, but playing them in a half-hearted way. It often comes
down to bad acting. Generally, improvisers guilty of this form of
detachment are simply “telling” and not “showing” an audience their
ideas. One example of unintentional detachment would be a man

playing a petite little girl without adjusting his voice or demeanor.
The improviser “says” he is a little girl but he fails to “be” a little girl.
Another example would be an improviser saying that they just broke
their leg in three places, but failing to limp or show any emotional
response to their injury.
./&"#+)*%$’+,-%"$)means consciously not committing to the reality
of the scene in order to get a laugh. Again, this will take the audience
out of the reality of the scene. This is also referred to as <5==$’)"’!.
The examples from the previous paragraph would be examples of ironic
detachment if the lack of commitment was intentional. Below are some
other examples of ironic detachment:
While commenting will often allow a performer to get a quick laugh,
that laugh will come at the expense of establishing a base reality, which
ultimately will undermine the integrity of the scene. Even a momentary
lapse in commitment can make it difficult for your audience to stay
engaged in the base reality of the scene.
The best improvisers completely commit themselves to their scenes.
You must commit to the character you are playing and your reality, and
never sell it out for a laugh or out of fear of not getting a laugh. The more
you commit to your character and the reality of the scene, the more
engaging the scene will be and the more likely it is that you will discover
what is truly funny about the scene.
In simplest terms, “top of your intelligence” refers to responding
truthfully to any stimulus within a scene. It is about allowing yourself
to have a true, honest emotional response. “Intelligence,” in this case, is
your knowledge of how a human being would react to a given situation.
This requires emotional and social intelligence. Playing at the top of
your intelligence means responding the way a real person would in a
given situation.
The principle of “show, don’t tell” comes into play here. It is not
enough to simply react verbally. In order to truly play at the top of your

intelligence, you will need to react emotionally as well. Marry your
verbal response with an emotional one.
For example, when another character pulls out a gun in a scene
and you are scared of it, you are playing at the top of your intelligence.
When you lovingly embrace your girlfriend upon hearing the news that
she is pregnant, you are playing at the top of your intelligence. When
your character touches something hot and you recoil in pain, you are
playing at the top of your intelligence. When you resentfully get coffee
for your mean boss or a rude customer, you are playing at the top of your
intelligence. It is important to note the above responses are not the only
valid responses to each given scenario. Any real or truthful response that
a person might have in any of these situations would also be considered
a “top of intelligence” response. For instance, in the case of hearing the
news that your girlfriend is pregnant, it is equally valid to respond in
shock or despair.
Commitment and playing at the top of your intelligence helps you to
create a rich base reality for your scene.

Denial
to agree with any aspect of
the reality established by your scene partner. You should look at every
contribution that your scene partner makes to the scene as a gift. If you

acknowledge and build upon these gifts, your job of finding a scene will
be easier.
Failing to agree with whatever your partner is trying to establish
about your scene can happen in many different ways at the beginning
of a scene. When it does, it puts you and your scene partner in a very
difficult position in terms of building a successful, funny scene.
There are many different forms of denial. One classic example of denial
is the ?>--"’!%)1$%/>! out denial. Let’s look at an example:
Player 2 has done something worse here than failing to add information
to the start of the scene. Player 2 has “pulled the rug out” from under
Player 1 and actively destroyed the information he has just been given%
+)1$%"($&%)1&)%1$%"2%&%?&)"$’)%&’(%)1&)%,-&.$/%A%"2%&%(5<)5/@. This is the
antithesis of Yes And, wherein information is created. Not only are
the improvisers back at square one, but they must now also deal with
the fact that Player 1 must be crazy or a liar for pretending to be a
doctor. Player 2 has denied himself and his scene partner the chance to
organically discover something unusual in their scene. The worst thing
about this denial is that it ruins what could have been a great idea from
Player 1. Denying your scene partners will make it impossible for you to
build trust with them.
Out of nervousness, many new improvisers will force something
unusual to happen at the start of a scene to get a laugh. One of the
quickest, cheapest, and easiest ways to make your audience laugh is to
make your scene partner seem crazy. Playing like this will make the
rest of your scene more difficult to perform, and it will turn you into an
improviser with whom nobody wants to play.
J$"’!%"’&))$’)"#$ is a more mild form of denial. It involves poor
listening and a failure to acknowledge what your scene partner has
established about the scene. “Being inattentive” denials are less
intentional than “pulling the rug out,” but they are just as damaging to
the start of the scene.

When you are inattentive, you can miss important details, such as the
gender, age, or name of the character your scene partner is playing. You
could also miss important information about the character of the space.
For instance, if your scene partner steps out shivering and you fail
to acknowledge that it is cold, you are denying an aspect of your reality
+)1&)%")%"2%<5-(@ being provided to you by your scene partner. This will
likely force some sort of explanation and take your focus away from
establishing the base reality of your scene.
Another common form of denial is referred to as (>$-"’!%"’")"&)"5’2. In
this form of denial, one of the improvisers refuses to let go of his or her
pre-conceived idea. They are unnecessarily forcing a new element into
the scene instead of building upon what their scene partner has offered
up. Here is a Dueling Initiations Example: Two improvisers doing a two-
person scene off of the suggestion “office.”

In this example, Player 2 has acknowledged the information established
by Player 1 while also adding in new information. The problem is that
this new information does not build upon anything established by the
scene initiation. Instead, Player 2 has rejected Player 1’s idea in favor
of his own. Instead of steamrolling with a new idea, Player 2 should be
looking to Yes And the specific base reality offered in the first line.
If you deny the contributions of your scene partner, you run the risk
of confusing your audience. Remember that in Long Form, we are
starting each scene in a blank space, a void without costumes or a
set. Given the lack of visual information, the audience is logically
going to latch onto and invest in whatever the improvisers establish
as the reality of the scene. A denial at the start of a scene is confusing
because it creates competing realities instead of a single reality that
you have built together.
The danger of denial extends beyond the obvious, practical pitfall
of confusing your audience. Denial that flies in the face of information
established by an initiation is often the product of a conscious choice.
Conscious choices like these often feel pushed or forced, especially at
the beginning of the scene. They are also usually just not as interesting
as the unusual thing that you would eventually discover with your scene
partner. An unusual thing that you discover with someone else will
always be more satisfying and much more fun to play with.
Don’t be tempted by the quick, easy laughs that you will sometimes
get from denial. You will be distinguishing yourself as a bad teammate
in exchange for these laughs. An improviser that relies on the sort of
cheap laughs you might get from a denial is like a basketball player that
does nothing but score by taking the ball away from the point guard on
his own team. When you deny your scene partner, you make them feel
cheated and unsupported. Single laughs coming from a denial will be at
the expense of consistent laughs later in the scene.
Making the game of your scene a denial is not the same as building a
scene with your scene partner. If you try to make every scene like this,
you have nothing more than a gimmick.
If your scene partner establishes the Who, What, or Where before you
do so in a scene, always drop your idea and go with theirs. Holding onto
your own ideas about the context of the scene could lead you to deny
your scene partner. Holding onto your own idea is also likely to create
confusion and disconnect between you and your fellow improviser.
Simply agreeing about the base reality of the scene is far more important
than the specifics of the reality itself. In the end, the memorable part

of the scene is not going to be the base reality of the scene (the Who,
What, and Where). The memorable part of the scene will be the funny
thing you discover that breaks from this base reality you and your scene
partner have created.
There is never a good reason to deny any aspect of the reality that
your scene partner has established. Denying your scene partner may
occasionally get a laugh, but it ultimately prevents you from finding a
strong, successful, funny scene.
We are now ready to move on to the “funny” part of the scene. As you
can see, an awful lot goes into the base reality of any scene. In many
ways, the success of a Long Form scene as a whole rides on what
happens in those first few lines.
You may feel overwhelmed at this point. Realize that this is a natural
part of the learning process. The only way you will ever own these
concepts is through lots of practice and repetition. You shouldn’t have
a disregard for the rules as you learn them; you should look to practice
them so much that you no longer find them overwhelming.
The many “rules” discussed for the beginning of the scene tend to
overwhelm new improvisers who are attempting to follow them all,
in the moment, while creating a scene. According to Del Close, to be
an improviser, one must be a juggler. Improvers have to be actors,
directors, and editors all at once. You are handling all of these skills
at once and you must also have a sense of where your scene could be
going. Inevitably, you are always carrying a little bit of baggage in some
part of your brain while you are improvising.
The challenge is to never let this baggage block the moment you’re
in. With repeated practice, the rules and instructions described as
being essential to the beginning of the scene do start to become second
nature. As this happens, you should find it easier and easier to truly “be
in the moment.”
Think back to when you first learned to ride a bike. Learning how to
ride was originally quite daunting. New bike riders are making constant
minor adjustments just to keep from falling over, and in spite of these
constant adjustments, new bike riders can expect to fall over many
times. However, once you finally learn how to ride, doing so becomes—
and usually remains—effortless. Keeping all of the rules straight when
doing your first Long Form scenes is very much like those first bike
rides, in which you had to consciously think about steering, pedaling,
and keeping balanced all at once. Right now, it is just important to
realize that time and practice will eventually make following the rules
more automatic.

The Game
of the Scene
In this section we introduce you to the concept of “the game of the
scene.” The game of the scene is the core of the UCB’s teaching. We
first started using the word “game” to describe the central funny idea of
our improv scenes while studying in Chicago. When we set up our own
classes in New York, we started developing the idea further. Now we see
game as the foundation of all comedy, and finding and playing game as
the primary goal of improvised comedy.
We developed most of the tools and terms in this section to help
students focus on finding and playing game to make their improv scenes
clear, focused, and funny.
This section contains a lot of what comprises the UCB style of improv.
As we’ve said before, game generally starts with an unusual thing
relative to the base reality. We talk about the concept of framing, a
term we use to describe how improvisers help each other notice when
something is unusual.
We introduce the idea of organic scenes and premise scenes.
Organic scenes start from just a suggestion, and use “Yes And” to

build a world and find an unusual thing. A premise scene depends
on the opening of a longform to provide a first unusual thing before
the scene begins. Premise scenes begin right away with an unusual
thing—shortening or eliminating the Yes And phase, and getting right
to the game.
We show you how to play the game once you’ve found one, using
heightening and exploring. Heightening is when you repeat and expand
what’s unusual. Exploring is when the characters give top-of-their-
intelligence reasons for doing unusual behavior.
We talk about the mechanics of various support moves players can
do to add to the games of scenes they were not in at the beginning.
We dispel some common misconceptions, and expand our
understanding of Yes And, agreement, and listening.
We explain that even when scenes become very absurd, we still use
top-of-your-intelligence reactions, good listening, strong commitment,
and supportive teamwork to ensure good scene work.
