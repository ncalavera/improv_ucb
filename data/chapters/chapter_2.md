## How to Create a Base Reality

In this chapter we go over how to make your base reality strong and truthful. The more truthful and committed you are with your base reality, the easier it will be for your game (the comedy of the scene) to stand out.

### Topics Covered

- Make ita priority to listen well
- Practice good give-and-take with each other
- Commit to the reality of the scene
- Avoid detachment—including unintentional detachment and ironic detachment
- Play to the top of your intelligence— don’t agree to things blindly or be oblivious to things for no reason
- Avoid denials, which include pulling the rug out, being inattentive and dueling initiations

## Listening

### Definition

When building a Long Form improv scene with someone else, there is nothing more important than listening. The beginning of the scene is built through Yes And, and you cannot Yes And something if you haven't heard it. It is important to listen because you are going to have to agree with and add to what your scene partner has just said. The last thing said on stage is either going to make your base reality more detailed and specific, or it will be the first unusual thing, the start of your game.

The start of the scene, like a basement, needs to be strong enough to support everything else that will be built upon it. Listening needs to happen so that you and your scene partner are on the same page about what kind of house you are building. If you don’t actively listen at the beginning of a scene, you may think that you are building a house out of straw, while your teammate thinks you are building it with bricks.

The goal of the beginning of the scene is to establish a relatable reality from which an unusual or absurd thing can be recognized. None of this will be possible if you are not actively listening. A great improviser is a good listener.

### Give And
TAKE

To be able to communicate effectively and build a Long Form scene with another improviser, you have to learn when to speak and when to listen. This is called give and take. One improviser shouldn't be doing all of the work in a scene. By giving and taking focus, you share the burden of discovery and creation. Giving and taking are equally important. It is important that you stop talking and give focus to your scene partner when they want to add to the scene. It is equally important that you begin speaking and take focus from them when you have something to contribute to the scene.

There is nothing more awkward to watch on stage than two improvisers fighting for focus. An ability to give and take focus is necessary for good listening.

## Exercise: COCKTAIL PARTY

### Instructions

- The participating improvisers split into groups of two or three and then spread out. Another improviser acts as a “conductor.”
- Each group is assigned a number.

Each group of improvisers should commit physically to the idea that they are different parts of the same cocktail party.

All three groups are given the same suggestion to inspire three different conversations. For example, if the suggestion was “gun,” one group may talk about gun control, another group may talk about Guns N’ Roses, and the third group may talk about video games.

The conductor calls out the number of the group that will have focus.

While one group is speaking, the others should mime a conversation while listening to what is being said.

When the conductor calls out a new number, the previous group gives focus by stopping their conversation. The new group takes focus by starting or resuming their conversation.

After a few rounds of calling out numbers, the conductor falls away and the three groups begin giving and taking focus on their own. The improvisers should look for natural pauses in conversation and take focus by loudly and clearly re-starting their conversation.

Each group should take the passage of time into consideration as they return to their conversation. You are not “pausing” your conversation and picking it up exactly where you left off; it should be assumed that your characters have been talking while you have been miming and the other group has had the focus in the scene.

### Variation

Use the same basic set-up, but this time each group should listen carefully to the group currently speaking.

After each group has had at least two opportunities to speak, you should look for ways to make connections between your conversation and the other conversations happening.

When your group retakes focus, try to incorporate specifics, details, ideas, and themes that you heard mentioned by the other groups.

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to allow improvisers to practice taking and giving focus in group scenes.

This variation of the exercise gives new improvisers another opportunity to practice listening.

If you are really listening to the other conversations, you should be able to find ways for themes and ideas to overlap naturally. This is a skill you will use often when performing Long Form.

## Exercise: “YES...AND” Scenework
### Instructions

- Atleast three improvisers are needed for this exercise.
- Two improvisers perform a scene from a single suggestion given by the third. The third improviser watches the scene.
- One improviser will initiate, or give the first line of the scene.
- Theimprovisers will then literally say “Yes And” at the start of each successive line. The “Yes And” will come in this form:
- “Yes” [repeat the information from the last line]
- “And” [add new information to the scene]
- Statements are necessary for this exercise. Questions won’t add new information; they will only force your scene partner to add information. Imperatives (e.g. “Come here!”) also fail because they often force your scene partner to do something without adding new information about the Who, What, and Where. Statements allow you to more quickly establish a reality and find something unusual to explore in that reality.
- Make sure that your Yes And statements add information to the present moment and the characters in the scene. Avoid Yes And statements that refer to the past, the future, or characters not in the scene.
- Resist the urge to “Yes...But.” Someone else in your group should stop the scene every time a scene partner says “But” instead of “And” to give them a chance to deliver a different line without “But.” “Yes...But” shows a desire to argue instead of building the scene together.
### Purpose

- One purpose of this exercise is to practice listening in a Long Form scene. You must be listening carefully in this exercise since you will have to repeat what was just said. Repeating the information from the previous line proves that you have been listening.
- When you add new information in your line, you are showing that you understand your partner’s contribution to the scene.
- Yes And scenes usually feel a little stilted. However, this exercise is essential for getting the behavior of Yes Anding into your muscle memory. Before things become second nature, we need to practice them consciously.
- This exercise will make it glaringly obvious whether or not you are listening. This exercise prevents you from skipping this important scene work step.

## “Yes...And” Scene Examples

### Example 1

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and I’m so happy you remembered our wedding anniversary.”

(Player 2 has established the Who and What with this “Yes And.” We now know that the characters are a married couple celebrating a wedding anniversary.)

### Player
1: “Yes, you’re happy I remembered our wedding anniversary, and let’s eat this tonight when we come home from dinner.”

(Player 1 has started to establish the Where with this “Yes And.” We now know that the couple is in their house, getting ready to go to dinner.)

### Example 2

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”
### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and everyone else in the office is going to be jealous of me.”

(Player 2 has established the Where with this “Yes And.” We now know that the characters are at their workplace.)

### Player
1: “Yes, everyone in the office will be jealous of you, and you just tell them that if their sales were as high as yours, I’d bake them an apple pie, too.”

### Bad
“YES...AND” SCENE EXAMPLES

### Example 1

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and it is on a plate.” (Player 2 has not really offered an “And” for the scene in this example. You want to go beyond the obvious of what you probably already know or could assume when you Yes And. No new information has been established with the “And” in this example.)

### Example 2

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and I used to have apple pie every Sunday when I was a kid.”

(Player 2 has made this scene about the past.)

### Example 3

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and Ill eat this tomorrow with my lunch.”

(Player 2 has made this scene about the future.)

### Example 4

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, and my brother Mike loves apple pie.”

(Player 2 has made the scene about a character not in the scene.)

### Example 5

### Player
1: “I baked you an apple pie.”

### Player
2: “Yes, you baked me an apple pie, but I’m not hungry.”

(Player 2 has done “yes but” instead of “Yes And.” Doing so will start your scenes off with unnecessary conflict.)

## Exercise: THREE LINE SCENES

### Instructions

Have any number of improvisers form two single-file lines on opposite sides of the stage. The line on the left side of the stage will be the “initiation” line. The line on the right will be the “response” line.

One improviser from each line will step forward to perform a scene inspired by a suggestion offered by someone else in the group.

- Left Side will initiate.
- Right Side will respond to the initiation. Left Side will respond to the response.
After the three lines, each improviser should go to the end of the opposite line. The next two improvisers in line then step out, get another suggestion, and do a new three-line scene.

These three-line scenes will not be complete scenes. They will end after the third line. These scenes don’t have to reach any sort of resolution. You should still make strong choices and commit as if these are going to be full-length scenes.

Continue until everyone has had a chance to initiate and respond.

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to practice establishing the Who, What, and Where as quickly and clearly as possible. It will be easier for you to establish this information if you make strong choices at the top of your scenes.

## Exercise: CONDUCTED STORY

### Instructions
Three or more improvisers stand in a line.

Another improviser will stand in front of them and act asa “conductor” for a story that they will tell together.

The conductor points at an improviser, who begins telling a story.

The conductor will then randomly point at a different improviser. The improviser currently speaking will abruptly stop telling the story. Then, the new improviser being pointed at will pick up telling the story at the exact moment where the previous improviser left off. The same rule will apply each time the conductor points to a new improviser.

The conductor can point to a new improviser at any time.

Caution: Don’t try to be funny. Don’t try to add absurd twists for laughs. Your only goal is to tell a simple story with aclear plot and consistent tone throughout, as if written by a single author.

### Purpose

This exercise will improve your listening by forcing you to be in the moment. You don’t know when you are going to be called on to speak. You could have to continue telling the story at any point—the end of a sentence or in the middle of a word. This means that you must be listening intently to know both what has been said just before you are called upon to speak, AND what has happened so farin the story as a whole.

If you do a good job of listening, you will be able to tell a seamless story that sounds as if it is coming from one person.

## Commitment

### Definition

There is a need for reality is Long Form

Improvisation. All elements of a scene outside of the game (or funny part of the scene) should be grounded in the reality that the performers have agreed upon. Obviously, this includes your performance. You could be following all of the rules we have presented and still not draw an audience into your reality if you do not commit.

In simplest terms, commitment is good acting. A Long Form improviser is expected to invest in the reality of the scene in such a way that the audience doesn’t see an improviser, but a believable character on stage. Good actors in movies or television disappear into their roles. Bad actors “take you out of the movie.” Good acting and commitment to the choices you make in a scene will help your audience become engaged in the reality you are creating.

A commitment to the reality of the scene does not mean that every scene you perform has to take place in our reality. It means that you can do scenes about vampires, pirates, or truckers in deep space, as long as you are committing to the specific reality in which we might find these sorts of characters. You must make choices about how to portray these characters and then remain consistent with your portrayal of the characters for the entire scene.

Focusing on commitment will prevent you from forcing an “unusual thing.” If you commit to your characters and portray them as real people, it will make it easier for you to recognize the unusual when it happens organically.

Commitment allows your audience to suspend disbelief and fully experience a fictional reality. The antithesis of commitment is detachment. Detachment makes the audience aware of the artifice of the scene, drawing attention to the fact that you are a comedian performing a scene as opposed to a character within the fictional reality of a scene.

Detachment generally comes in one of two forms: unintentional detachment and ironic detachment.

Unintentional detachment is the result of improvisers making choices, but playing them in a half-hearted way. It often comes down to bad acting. Generally, improvisers guilty of this form of detachment are simply “telling” and not “showing” an audience their ideas. One example of unintentional detachment would be a man playing a petite little girl without adjusting his voice or demeanor. The improviser “says” he is a little girl but he fails to “be” a little girl. Another example would be an improviser saying that they just broke their leg in three places, but failing to limp or show any emotional response to their injury.

Ironic detachment means consciously not committing to the reality of the scene in order to get a laugh. Again, this will take the audience out of the reality of the scene. This is also referred to as commenting. The examples from the previous paragraph would be examples of ironic detachment if the lack of commitment was intentional. Below are some
### Other Examples Of Ironic Detachment

- You are in a courtroom scene and choose to comment on the fact that there are only two chairs in the room. (You are not committing to the fictional reality of the Where.)
- Your male scene partner is playing a woman and you make a “boy, you’re an ugly woman” remark. (You are not committing to the fictional reality of the Who.)
- You are playing Paul Revere and say something like, “It’s a shame that there isn’t some sort of mobile device that would allow me to contact my fellow colonists remotely.” (You are not committing to the fictional reality of the What.)
While commenting will often allow a performer to get a quick laugh, that laugh will come at the expense of establishing a base reality, which ultimately will undermine the integrity of the scene. Even a momentary lapse in commitment can make it difficult for your audience to stay engaged in the base reality of the scene.

The best improvisers completely commit themselves to their scenes. You must commit to the character you are playing and your reality, and never sell it out for a laugh or out of fear of not getting a laugh. The more you commit to your character and the reality of the scene, the more engaging the scene will be and the more likely it is that you will discover what is truly funny about the scene.

### Top Of Your
INTELLIGENCE

In simplest terms, “top of your intelligence” refers to responding truthfully to any stimulus within a scene. It is about allowing yourself to have a true, honest emotional response. “Intelligence,” in this case, is your knowledge of how a human being would react to a given situation. This requires emotional and social intelligence. Playing at the top of your intelligence means responding the way a real person would in a given situation.

The principle of “show, don’t tell” comes into play here. It is not enough to simply react verbally. In order to truly play at the top of your intelligence, you will need to react emotionally as well. Marry your verbal response with an emotional one.

For example, when another character pulls out a gun in a scene and you are scared of it, you are playing at the top of your intelligence.

When you lovingly embrace your girlfriend upon hearing the news that she is pregnant, you are playing at the top of your intelligence. When your character touches something hot and you recoil in pain, you are playing at the top of your intelligence. When you resentfully get coffee for your mean boss or a rude customer, you are playing at the top of your intelligence. It is important to note the above responses are not the only valid responses to each given scenario. Any real or truthful response that a person might have in any of these situations would also be considered a “top of intelligence” response. For instance, in the case of hearing the news that your girlfriend is pregnant, it is equally valid to respond in shock or despair.

### What Top Of Your Intelligence Is
NOT

Top of your intelligence is often misunderstood. Top of your intelligence does not mean that you should have your character rattle off trivial or obscure facts. It does not mean that your character has to be “smart.” It does not mean that you should quip cleverly or show off how well educated you may be in real life. It also does not mean that every character you play has to know everything that you know. If you are playing a character dumber than you are, your character will not know everything that you do.

Commitment and playing at the top of your intelligence helps you to create a rich base reality for your scene.

## Exercise: GIVE THE SETUP

### Instructions
### Part One

Two improvisers take the stage.

Instead of receiving a suggestion, every scene will start with the two improvisers having a conversation as their actual selves. The improvisers in this scene should focus on playing the sceneina grounded, realistic, and truthful way. The scene should have a casual or conversational tone.

A third improviser will stop them if they feels that either improviser is “performing” or not acting realistically in any way. This third improviser should be asking themself, “Is this really what either of these people would say?” in order to find those moments that are not realistic or genuine.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

### Part Two

Now each pair of improvisers will be given a simple, specific, and relatable scenario or “set-up” to start with (e.g. two parents watching their kids in a little league game, a second date at a familiar chain restaurant, etc.).

Again, the improvisers should play close to themselves in these scenes. Their focus should once again be on playing themselves in a grounded, realistic, and truthful way.

A third improviser should look to stop the scene any time either performer in the scene is not acting realistically.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

### Part Three

Now each pair should be given the suggestion of two character archetypes that will be different from their actual selves, but within the realm of possibility in real life (e.g. two astronauts, the Pope anda Cardinal, the President and the First Lady, etc.).

The goal of both players in these scenes is to play these character archetypes in the same grounded, realistic, and truthful manner that they played themselves in Part One.

The third improviser looking to stop the scene can judge the success of this part of the exercise by considering how closely these scenes resemble the tone and execution of those scenes in Part One. Again, the third improviser should stop the scene any time either performer in the scene is not acting realistically.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

### Part Four

For the final section of this exercise, each pair should be given the suggestion of two character archetypes that are so fundamentally different from their actual selves that they could not “be” them in real life. These character archetypes should require the improvisers to alter their voices and physicality (e.g. two elderly people, two Russian immigrants, etc.).

Again, the goal of both players in these scenes is to play these characters in the same, grounded, realistic, and truthful manner that they played themselves in Part One.

While the improvisers will need to adopt a character voice or different way of moving in these scenes, they should make these traits as realistic as they can.

The third improviser can once again judge the success of this part of the exercise by looking for how closely these scenes resemble the tone and execution of those scenes in Part One. This third improviser should now be asking, “Is this really what either of these types of people would say or do in real life?” in order to find those moments that are not realistic or genuine.

Once the “unreal” moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.

Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.

### Additional Tips

Start your scenes “in the middle.” That means initiating with a specific statement and assuming or labeling a relationship from the start. Starting your scenes “in the middle” is a good idea in general.

Remember the lessons from the “TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE” exercise. In real life, you usually don’t just talk about whatever it is that you are doing as you are doing it. You usually talk about lots of other things: work, your family, your friends, interests, etc. Use the scenes in this exercise as an opportunity to practice doing this. The third improviser watching these scenes should stop the scene if the improvisers get trapped into talking about what they are doing.

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to focus on playing the reality of the scene in a believable way. If you are able to successfully portray characters and situations that feel real and grounded, the absurd element of the scene will stand out better in contrast. It is easier to recognize the unusual in a scene if we begin our scenes with a familiar situation or recognizable reality.

This exercise also reinforces that our ideas for scenes do not have to be crazy, wacky, forced or complicated at the start. In fact, starting with the familiar increases our odds of finding a first unusual thing.

## Exercise: WOULD YOU?

### Instructions
Have two improvisers take the stage.

Do a series of two-person scenes where the suggestion must be an emotionally charged scenario (e.g. finding out you have cancer, being involved in a robbery, going on a first date, etc.).

Video-record these scenes. As a group, watch each scene.

Stop line-by-line and ask the improviser in the scene variations on the question, “Would you...?” in relation to their action and dialogue (e.g. “Would you have really reacted that way to a person in real life?”)

Each answer should be an honest assessment of whether or not they were successful in giving their character realistic human behavior.

Whenever the question is answered with some version of “No,” discuss other options this improviser had in that scene.

### Purpose

This exercise is a great way to consider how you are reacting in

Analyzing your scene work in the moment is extremely difficult. Watching scenes on videotape after the fact allows you to step outside of your own performance and really focus on your tendencies as a performer.

## Denial

### Definition

Denial means failing to agree with any aspect of the reality established by your scene partner. You should look at every contribution that your scene partner makes to the scene as a gift. If you acknowledge and build upon these gifts, your job of finding a scene will be easier.

Failing to agree with whatever your partner is trying to establish about your scene can happen in many different ways at the beginning of a scene. When it does, it puts you and your scene partner in a very difficult position in terms of building a successful, funny scene.

### Pulling The Rug
OUT

There are many different forms of denial. One classic example of denial is the pulling the rug out denial. Let’s look at an example:

Player 1 steps out and mimes opening a medical file.

### Player
1: “Your test results have come back. I have some good news for you.”

### Player
2: “You’re not a doctor! Why are you acting like a

Player 2 has done something worse here than failing to add information to the start of the scene. Player 2 has “pulled the rug out” from under Player 1 and actively destroyed the information he has just been given (the idea that he is a patient and that Player 1 is a doctor). This is the antithesis of Yes And, wherein information is created. Not only are the improvisers back at square one, but they must now also deal with the fact that Player 1 must be crazy or a liar for pretending to be a doctor. Player 2 has denied himself and his scene partner the chance to organically discover something unusual in their scene. The worst thing about this denial is that it ruins what could have been a great idea from Player 1. Denying your scene partners will make it impossible for you to build trust with them.

Out of nervousness, many new improvisers will force something unusual to happen at the start of a scene to get a laugh. One of the quickest, cheapest, and easiest ways to make your audience laugh is to make your scene partner seem crazy. Playing like this will make the rest of your scene more difficult to perform, and it will turn you into an improviser with whom nobody wants to play.

### Being
INATTENTIVE

Being inattentive is a more mild form of denial. It involves poor listening and a failure to acknowledge what your scene partner has established about the scene. “Being inattentive” denials are less intentional than “pulling the rug out,” but they are just as damaging to the start of the scene.

### Coffee Pot Baseball
BAT

When you are inattentive, you can miss important details, such as the gender, age, or name of the character your scene partner is playing. You could also miss important information about the character of the space.

For instance, if your scene partner steps out shivering and you fail to acknowledge that it is cold, you are denying an aspect of your reality (that it is cold) being provided to you by your scene partner. This will likely force some sort of explanation and take your focus away from establishing the base reality of your scene.

### Dueling
INITIATIONS

Another common form of denial is referred to as dueling initiations. In this form of denial, one of the improvisers refuses to let go of his or her pre-conceived idea. They are unnecessarily forcing a new element into the scene instead of building upon what their scene partner has offered up. Here is a Dueling Initiations Example: Two improvisers doing a two-person scene off of the suggestion “office.”

Player 1 walks on stage, miming a coffee cup in his hand.

### Player
1: “If you finish the break room coffee, you need to start a new pot.”

### Player
2: “Look, I’ll get to that. We need to bring in a ringer for the company softball team or else we’re gonna get destroyed.”

In this example, Player 2 has acknowledged the information established by Player 1 while also adding in new information. The problem is that this new information does not build upon anything established by the scene initiation. Instead, Player 2 has rejected Player 1’s idea in favor of his own. Instead of steamrolling with a new idea, Player 2 should be looking to Yes And the specific base reality offered in the first line.

DENIAL’S EFFECT ON THE AUDIENCE

If you deny the contributions of your scene partner, you run the risk of confusing your audience. Remember that in Long Form, we are starting each scene in a blank space, a void without costumes ora set. Given the lack of visual information, the audience is logically going to latch onto and invest in whatever the improvisers establish as the reality of the scene. A denial at the start of a scene is confusing because it creates competing realities instead of a single reality that you have built together.

The danger of denial extends beyond the obvious, practical pitfall of confusing your audience. Denial that flies in the face of information established by an initiation is often the product of a conscious choice. Conscious choices like these often feel pushed or forced, especially at the beginning of the scene. They are also usually just not as interesting as the unusual thing that you would eventually discover with your scene partner. An unusual thing that you discover with someone else will always be more satisfying and much more fun to play with.

Don’t be tempted by the quick, easy laughs that you will sometimes get from denial. You will be distinguishing yourself as a bad teammate in exchange for these laughs. An improviser that relies on the sort of cheap laughs you might get from a denial is like a basketball player that does nothing but score by taking the ball away from the point guard on his own team. When you deny your scene partner, you make them feel cheated and unsupported. Single laughs coming from a denial will be at the expense of consistent laughs later in the scene.

Making the game of your scene a denial is not the same as building a scene with your scene partner. If you try to make every scene like this, you have nothing more than a gimmick.

### Avoiding
DENIAL

If your scene partner establishes the Who, What, or Where before you do so in a scene, always drop your idea and go with theirs. Holding onto your own ideas about the context of the scene could lead you to deny your scene partner. Holding onto your own idea is also likely to create confusion and disconnect between you and your fellow improviser. Simply agreeing about the base reality of the scene is far more important than the specifics of the reality itself. In the end, the memorable part of the scene is not going to be the base reality of the scene (the Who, What, and Where). The memorable part of the scene will be the funny thing you discover that breaks from this base reality you and your scene partner have created.

There is never a good reason to deny any aspect of the reality that your scene partner has established. Denying your scene partner may occasionally get a laugh, but it ultimately prevents you from finding a strong, successful, funny scene.

### Take A Breath & Hang In
THERE

We are now ready to move on to the “funny” part of the scene. As you can see, an awful lot goes into the base reality of any scene. In many ways, the success of a Long Form scene as a whole rides on what happens in those first few lines.

You may feel overwhelmed at this point. Realize that this is a natural part of the learning process. The only way you will ever own these concepts is through lots of practice and repetition. You shouldn't have a disregard for the rules as you learn them; you should look to practice them so much that you no longer find them overwhelming.

The many “rules” discussed for the beginning of the scene tend to overwhelm new improvisers who are attempting to follow them all, in the moment, while creating a scene. According to Del Close, to be an improviser, one must be a juggler. Improvers have to be actors, directors, and editors all at once. You are handling all of these skills at once and you must also have a sense of where your scene could be going. Inevitably, you are always carrying a little bit of baggage in some part of your brain while you are improvising.

The challenge is to never let this baggage block the moment you're in. With repeated practice, the rules and instructions described as being essential to the beginning of the scene do start to become second nature. As this happens, you should find it easier and easier to truly “be in the moment.”

Think back to when you first learned to ride a bike. Learning how to ride was originally quite daunting. New bike riders are making constant minor adjustments just to keep from falling over, and in spite of these constant adjustments, new bike riders can expect to fall over many times. However, once you finally learn how to ride, doing so becomes— and usually remains—effortless. Keeping all of the rules straight when doing your first Long Form scenes is very much like those first bike rides, in which you had to consciously think about steering, pedaling, and keeping balanced all at once. Right now, it is just important to realize that time and practice will eventually make following the rules more automatic.

## The Game Of The Scene
In this section we introduce you to the concept of “the game of the scene.” The game of the scene is the core of the UCB’s teaching. We first started using the word “game” to describe the central funny idea of our improv scenes while studying in Chicago. When we set up our own classes in New York, we started developing the idea further. Now we see game as the foundation of all comedy, and finding and playing game as the primary goal of improvised comedy. We developed most of the tools and terms in this section to help students focus on finding and playing game to make their improv scenes clear, focused, and funny. This section contains a lot of what comprises the UCB style of improv. As we’ve said before, game generally starts with an unusual thing relative to the base reality. We talk about the concept of framing, a term we use to describe how improvisers help each other notice when something is unusual. We introduce the idea of organic scenes and premise scenes. Organic scenes start from just a suggestion, and use “Yes And” to build a world and find an unusual thing. A premise scene depends on the opening of a longform to provide a first unusual thing before the scene begins. Premise scenes begin right away with an unusual thing—shortening or eliminating the Yes And phase, and getting right to the game. We show you how to play the game once you’ve found one, using heightening and exploring. Heightening is when you repeat and expand what’s unusual. Exploring is when the characters give top-of-their-intelligence reasons for doing unusual behavior. We talk about the mechanics of various support moves players can do to add to the games of scenes they were not in at the beginning. We dispel some common misconceptions, and expand our understanding of Yes And, agreement, and listening. We explain that even when scenes become very absurd, we still use top-of-your-intelligence reactions, good listening, strong commitment, and supportive teamwork to ensure good scene work.
