Hi! Lam Amy Poehler anc this is tne official foreword for The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual.

This book is a comprehensive guide to the UCB style of long form improvisation. It is an attempt to help clearly explain how we improvise, why we improvise, and what we think works best when performing long form improvisation. Now, if none of the words in that last sentence make any sense to you...you're in luck! This book assumes you know nothing, It contains real and practical information on improvisation, without assuming you know the basics.

We love to improvise and we take this funny art form very seriously. We attempt to take a pragmatic approach at how to explain the "rules" of long form improvisation. We have all improvised most of our adult lives and we have combined our experiences as performers and teachers in an attempt to clearly lay out ways to describe the UCB style.

Improvisation is about having a real sense of trust with your partner. It's about sharing a language that allows you the freedom to play. Creativity among structure. Risk among rules. In this book you will learn about group mind, playing to the top of your intelligence, and finding the game. It investigates everything from the simple beginning steps of getting a suggestion, to building base realities that can lead you to all different types of improv forms. The hope is that this instruction can guide you or your group into a real sense of flow. There is nothing better than the feeling of being lost in that magical and creative improvisational zone. But before you get the rush of the wind in your hair during an exciting downhill bike ride, you need to learn how to put your foot on the bike pedals and find your brake. Here is another metaphor, if improvisation is a game of basketball, then this book is the manual that teaches you to play. Once you get on the court and know how to play, it becomes about the team and the flow and energy of each game. But that creative and fluid experience can only be reached if you know the fundamentals. And if you can't take a UCB improv class in person this is the next, best thing. So let's get started. We hope this book helps. And on behalf of all of us, thanks for buying it.
