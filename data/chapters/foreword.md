and this is the official
foreword for The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual.
This book is a comprehensive guide to the UCB style of long form
improvisation. It is an attempt to help clearly explain how we improvise,
why we improvise, and what we think works best when performing long
form improvisation. Now, if none of the words in that last sentence make
any sense to you"you’re in luck! This book assumes you know nothing,
It contains real and practical information on improvisation, without
assuming you know the basics.
We love to improvise and we take this funny art form very seriously.
We attempt to take a pragmatic approach at how to explain the “rules” of
long form improvisation. We have all improvised most of our adult lives
and we have combined our experiences as performers and teachers in
an attempt to clearly lay out ways to describe the UCB style.
Improvisation is about having a real sense of trust with your partner.
It’s about sharing a language that allows you the freedom to play.
Creativity among structure. Risk among rules. In this book you will learn
!

about group mind, playing to the top of your intelligence, and finding
the game. It investigates everything from the simple beginning steps of
getting a suggestion, to building base realities that can lead you to all
different types of improv forms.
The hope is that this instruction can guide you or your group into a
real sense of flow. There is nothing better than the feeling of being lost
in that magical and creative improvisational zone. But before you get the
rush of the wind in your hair during an exciting downhill bike ride, you
need to learn how to put your foot on the bike pedals and find your brake.
Here is another metaphor, if improvisation is a game of basketball,
then this book is the manual that teaches you to play. Once you get on
the court and know how to play, it becomes about the team and the flow
and energy of each game. But that creative and fluid experience can only
be reached if you know the fundamentals. And if you can’t take a UCB
improv class in person this is the next, best thing.
So let’s get started. We hope this book helps. And on behalf of all of
us, thanks for buying it.

Here′s a brief history of the UCB and the UCB Theatre. This is to give
a context of where and how the authors learned improv and developed
the philosophies that this book describes.
We, the authors of this book—Matt Besser, Ian Roberts and Matt
Walsh—have had a lot of experience performing and teaching improv
over the last thirty years.
The three of us, along with Amy Poehler, first met in Chicago in the
early 1990s, where we performed improv and sketch as the Upright
Citizens Brigade.
Chicago has always been fertile ground for young improv talent.
Long Form improv essentially started there in the late 1950s when
young actors such as Mike Nichols and Elaine May started performing
improvised shows, inspired by the teachings of Viola Spolin and others.
Famed comedy theater the Second City was founded shortly after.
The 1990s saw an explosion of talent in the Chicago improv scene.
A big part of this was the iO Theater, founded in the 1980s by Charna
Halpern with longtime improv teacher and director Del Close.
Presenting a large number of shows each week, iO allowed lots of young
and hungry talent to get stage time. Among the performers who began
their careers in 1990s Chicago were Tina Fey, Adam McKay, Rachel
Dratch, Scott Adsit, Andy Richter, Horatio Sanz, Seth Meyers, Jon
Favreau—and many others. We were among this generation. The UCB
was part of a movement of fast, aggressive improv comedy that was
absurd but still, at its core, grounded.
In 1996, the UCB decided to move from Chicago to New York City
hoping to get on television. We rose up through the ranks of the local
alternative comedy scene, soon realizing our goal of getting on television
when Comedy Central gave us a sketch show that ran for three seasons.
%

During this time, we performed improv shows and taught improv
classes, providing our take on the skills we’d learned in Chicago. We
opened our own theater, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, in New
York in 1999. In 2005, we opened a second theater in Los Angeles.
Thousands of people have taken classes at the UCB. Among our
alumni are many people who have gone on to professional success in
movies and television. As we are writing this book, a small sampling
includes: Anthony Atamanuik, Rachel Bloom, Nicole Byer, D’Arcy
Carden, Rob Corddry, Andy Daly, Jon Daly, Brett Gelman, Ilana Glazer,
Donald Glover, Rob Huebel, Abbi Jacobson, Lauren Lapkus, Kate
McKinnon, Jason Mantzoukas, Bobby Moynihan, Ego Nwodim, Adam
Pally, Lennon Parham, Aubrey Plaza, June Raphael, Rob Riggle, Paul
Scheer, Ben Schwartz, Jessica St. Clair, Casey Wilson, Zach Woods,
Sasheer Zamata, and many many more.
In addition to those achieving fame, there are many other students
who became terrific regular performers on the UCB stages, and
eventually teachers. The four original UCB members, as well as the
teachers they trained, started writing down their teaching philosophy
as a curriculum. Many people contributed to this endeavor—including
Owen Burke, Kevin Mullaney, Chris Gethard, and Joe Wengert. The
teachings were a mixture of Chicago-style Long Form, with the UCB’s
focus on finding the “game of the scene,” combined with new techniques
that evolved through our classes.
In 2011, we started writing this book. We published the first edition
in 2013. In 2019, we revised it, making many small revisions throughout,
including new exercises, updated terms and examples and a major
rewrite of the “pattern game” section.

It’s a great irony that to get good at comedy, you have to take it seriously.
This is especially surprising when first looking at Long Form improv
comedy. Scenes can be so absurd and unpredictable, you might assume
that anything goes. Since there are no costumes or props or script, you
might feel improv requires no preparation.
But of course that’s not true. Though there are no HARD rules, improv
works best when the players adhere to a clear set of guidelines everyone
has practiced. You !"#$#%!, you &’"#$()$(*%$()&$)+$#),-$./(%’’.0%/1%2$#),$
’))3$+)-$,/,!,"’$(*./0!2$#),$*%.0*(%/$"/4$%5&’)-% (we explain all these
principles later).
As for preparation, it’s true you can’t rehearse a scene that you
make up on the spot. But all good improvisers invest a lot of time doing
&

exercises, practices, and shows so they’re comfortable with anything
that comes their way.
Improv is fun, for sure. But it’s not easy. It’s an art form, which
requires discipline and practice.
At the time we are writing this book, we have been performing
and teaching improv for almost thirty years. We love improv, we’ve
worked hard at it, and we take it seriously. This book will teach you the
guidelines we use.

There are two general types of improv: Short Form improvisation
and Long Form improvisation.
In Short Form improvisation, a group plays a series of established
“games” in which the group tells the audience the rules and structure
ahead of time. Something like “In this game, two people will do a scene
while a third person keeps shouting different emotions for them to play.”
We don’t practice Short Form at the UCB Theatre. It can be entertaining,
but the downside is Short Form games tend to be very similar each time
you do them.
We do Long Form improvisation. That means creating one or more
scenes without a script. You don’t know for sure where the humor will
come from. Ideally, Long Form scenes look like written sketches. This
is a tradition of comedy that grew out of the Chicago theater scene and
included the improv duo Nichols and May, and theater companies like
the Second City, iO Theater and others).
For example, you have a scene of a fireman talking to his chief. You
discover the fireman wants to stop using sirens on trucks. “They’re too
scary, it makes people panic,” he reasons. He wants instead to use a very
upbeat theme song he’s written called “Hooray for the Firemen!” He also
wants to replace the “intimidating” dalmatian with a bunny rabbit, and
wants helmets painted rainbow colors, like a clown’s wig, instead of an
“alarming” red.
There was no plan going into the scene. But we still say this scene
had a game. It was a game we discovered along the way. You might call
it:$"$6-%7"/$())$8)--.%4$"9),($!1"-./0$&%)&’%:
We call this the game of the scene. The game of the scene, in the
simplest terms possible, is the single specific idea that makes a scene
funny. The unusual point of view, the surprising behavior, the absurd
character, whatever it is. Each scene’s game is unique. If you know what
the game of the scene is, you know what to explore and heighten to
further what’s making the scene funny.
’

Finding games in Long Form is harder than in Short Form. But if you
do it well, it’s more satisfying, more surprising and unique, and funnier.
The concept of the game of the scene is the linchpin of the Upright
Citizens Brigade’s teaching and performance of Long Form improv.
We learned to use the term “game” in Long Form while studying with
legendary Chicago improv teachers Del Close and Charna Halpern in the
1990s. But since then, we’ve expanded the concept and used it to make
the free-form nature of Long Form improv have a measurable goal: find
a game and play it.

Just reading this book alone will not make you a great improviser. You
will also need constant practice and performance. As with any other art
form, you will not become a competent improviser by just reading about
how to do it. Experience will be your best teacher, so you must find the
time to practice and perform as much as possible.
But it’s our hope that this book will be a foundation for anyone
interested in performing Long Form improv. Maybe you live in a place
where there’s not a local improv scene. This book should give you
enough information to get started. It provides exercises, examples, and
structures for shows, as well as vocabulary terms you can use to discuss
scenes among your group.
Improv is a deeply satisfying art form, in which you work together to
create great comedy: surprising, truthful, absurd, and fun. We hope this
book helps you love it just as much as we do.

Let’s go over the basic anatomy of an improv scene. There are many
terms in this section which we’ll go over later. This is just a quick
overview of what we’re going to cover.
We start an improv scene with what we call the “base reality” section
of the scene. As we said before, this is the general scenario of what’s
going on. Ex: A parent and child driving to school, a patient visiting the
doctor for a checkup, a cowboy walking into a saloon and ordering a
whiskey. This section of the scene sets up a realistic world with expected
rules or patterns of behavior which can then be broken for comedic
effect. We create this section of the scene using the improv principle of
“Yes And.”
The base reality section continues until we find a “first unusual thing,”
which breaks the expected pattern of the base reality. At this point we
enter the section known as “the game” of the scene. Ex: The drill sergeant
who’s into yoga, the mom who wants her kids to vandalize the school, the
waiter who is so pretentious that he rejects all customers’ orders.
We find the game of the scene by using the improv principle of
“If Then,” continually asking the question, “If this unusual thing is
true, then what else is true?” The answers to this question provide the
comedic content of the game.

The
Beginning
of a Scene
In this section of the book, we go over how to create what we call a
base reality. That’s the world of the scene. It’s the who-what-where,
the general situation, the context, the what’s-going-on. A football team
meeting at halftime. Two friends sitting next to each other on the
subway. Even something fantastical like two aliens negotiating a peace
treaty to end the global insect wars. These are all possible base realities
for a scene.
The UCB coined the term base reality to emphasize that this is the
base of our scene. We’ll build the comedy—the game—on top of it.
That means the base reality should not be played for laughs. Even if it’s
fantastical, it’s played “real” relative to its situation. This is important
because we’ll need to be able to identify the first unusual thing that
happens—relative to this base reality—to start finding the game.
Agreement is crucial when we start our scenes. We go over how
the classic improv mantra Yes And lets you quickly build a base reality
together. We also discuss the importance of good listening, strong
commitment, and playing realistically when developing your base reality.
