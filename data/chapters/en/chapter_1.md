Yes And

### Definition

Yes And. These two simple words are the building blocks of every Long Form improv scene. “Yes” refers to the idea that you should be agreeing with any information your scene partner gives you about your reality. “And” refers to the adding of new information that relates to the previous information. Yes And is very important at the beginning of every scene, since it will allow you and your scene partner to discover the base reality in which your characters exist.

When we speak to people in real life, we move the conversation forward by adding new information in response to what has already been communicated. Imagine that you are talking with a group of friends. If everybody else is telling stories about their dog, and you start talking about how good you are at basketball out of the blue, you haven't added to the conversation already in progress. In order to successfully participate in this conversation, you should offer another dog story. Yes And is how we mirror this process in our scene work.

At the very start of a Long Form scene, you and your scene partner will have absolutely no information about who your characters are, what they are doing, and where they are. By following the principle of Yes And, you can work together to quickly determine the base reality of the scene. By continually agreeing with what has been established and adding new, related information, you will establish a base reality against which you will be able to recognize the first unusual thing when it happens. This is important because the first unusual thing is the beginning of the game, or comedy, of the scene.

In general, make Yes And choices that add details about the present moment or the people in the scene. Do not add information about the past, the future, or people who aren't there.

Think of a Long Form scene as a painting. If you were going to paint your idea in blue, you wouldn’t want to start with a blue canvas. tl? T

You wouldn't be able to differentiate between the foundation and your art. Blue doesn’t show up well on blue. Starting scenes with a clearly communicated and specific base reality is like starting your scenes with a white canvas on which the blue paint of what is funny will show up vibrantly.

### The First Line Of Your Scene

To begin Yes Anding, you need a first line for your scene. The first line of an improv scene is called the initiation. Although you could conjure this out of nothing, the initiation is usually inspired by a suggestion provided by someone other than the performers. A suggestion is taken for two reasons. First, the suggestion serves as inspiration for the improvisers. Second, it proves that they are indeed improvising and that the scene has not been scripted.

When you get a suggestion, you want to notice the connection you immediately make to it in your mind, and then use that connection to fashion an initiation. The suggestion may or may not be used in the initiation, depending on the connection you have made.

### Example Suggestion: balloon

If “balloon” made you think of how your mother used to tie balloons to your wrist so you didn’t lose them, you might offer the

### Following Initiation

### Initiation
ONE: “I’m going to tie the balloon
around your wrist so you don’t lose it, honey.”

If “balloon” made you think of a birthday party, you might offer the

### Following Initiation

### Initiation
TWO: “Okay, blow out the candles and
make a wish.”

In both of these examples, the audience should see the connection between the suggestion and your initiation.

Make sure that your initiation line starts the scene “in the middle of things.” You want an initiation that allows you to get to the important part of an interaction as quickly as possible. Avoid any extraneous dialogue leading up to this moment.

Notice that in our first example, we didn’t need to start with the characters noticing the balloon vendor or the transaction of buying the balloon. In the second example, we didn’t need to start with people arriving at the party or people placing gifts on the gift table. In both

### Examples, We Cut To The Chase By Starting “in The Middle.”

You should initiate off of your suggestion immediately. If you hesitate, it shows that you are planning and not improvising.

### Yes And, Inother Words

ee YES AND AGREEING ADD TO

### Yes And Examples

It is important to point out that Yes Anding does not mean literally saying the words “Yes And” before you add new information.

### Example 1

SUGGESTION: balloon
Player 1 mimes knocking on a door. Player 2 answers the door.

**Player 1:** “Hi, I’m the magician for the birthday party.”

**Player 2:** “Yes, and the kids are all in the rec room having cake and ice cream.”

For the sake of example, we have used the words “Yes” and “And” in Player 2’s response. However, in performance, Yes Anding will look

### Something More Like This

### Example 2

SUGGESTION: balloon

Player 1 mimes knocking on a door. Player 2 answers the door.

**Player 1:** “Hi, I’m the magician for the birthday party.”

**Player 2:** “Great! The kids are all in the rec room having cake and ice cream.” The same information is conveyed in Example 2 as was conveyed in

### Example 1
While the words “Yes” and “And” weren’t literally said, the rule of Yes And (agreeing and adding new information) was still employed.

## Exercise: FIND YES AND IN A REAL CONVERSATION

### Instructions

As we have already mentioned, Yes And naturally occurs in most conversations all of the time.

The next time you are on public transportation, in a restaurant alone, or at a crowded party, try to zero in on a conversation and listen for Yes Anding. Are these people Yes Anding each other? Is their ability to Yes And each other having an effect on the conversation? In good conversations, you will notice that people are constantly Yes Anding without being conscious of doing so.

Also try to look for conversations in which an absence of Yes And ruins the conversation. These will be conversations in which one speaker changes topics without segue, doesn’t listen, or only talks about themselves. These behaviors to be avoided in conversation should also be avoided in scene work.

### Purpose

- This exercise allows you to practice Yes And outside of the classroom or rehearsal studio. Recognizing how Yes And naturally occurs will make you better at using this concept in your scene work.

### Honor The Reality Of The Scene

New improvisers often look to force something “crazy” or “wacky” at the beginning of scenes, or they will rush to a conflict (an argument) with their scene partner instead of adding information through Yes Anding. New improvisers do this because they are worried about being funny and do not yet have faith in the rules of improv.

Agreement

### Definition

In order to create a Long Form scene with another improviser, the very first thing you must do is come to agreement with each other about the basic context of the scene you are performing. Imagine that you are going to dance with someone. Are you going to waltz or salsa? You would be able to tell almost immediately from the first action your dance partner takes. Joining in with this first choice (whether it is waltz or salsa) may seem very obvious and simple, but it is undoubtedly essential if dancing is to happen at all. A failure to come to basic agreement about the context of the scene stops a scene from succeeding before it even starts.

Two improvisers should be looking to agree from the very start of the scene. It is important to note that even though you are in the pursuit of comedy, you are not “going for laughs” at this point in a scene. You are going for the establishment of a reality. Normally, what we find to be “funny” in a scene is a break from the expected norms of reality. For the unusual to stand out from the commonplace, it is important that you and your partner start the scene in agreement about a normal reality. If you start off a scene in which everything is crazy or funny, it will be difficult to determine what is unusual.

### Character Of The SPACE

The most basic form of agreement involves the character of the space. As soon as two improvisers walk on stage—before they even begin talking—they are more likely to find success if they can come to a basic agreement about the physical and/or emotional state of their characters.

As you enter a scene, your first job is to acknowledge any choice about the character of the space that your scene partner has made. (Your scene partner will do the same if you are the one to step out first.) You should then find a way to fit into that same physical space.

For example, if your scene partner steps out and is shivering, you could mirror or match this action and shiver as well. You are agreeing that it is cold. You are allowing your characters to start off in the same environmental condition.

Maybe your scene partner has stepped out, sighed, and mimed mopping their brow with a handkerchief. If you enter the scene fanning your face, you have acknowledged the character of the space without matching your partner’s exact physical choice. You are showing that your character is also hot in a different way.

You can also come to agreement about the character of the space through the physical environment of the scene or an activity your characters might be engaged in. If your scene partner starts the scene hunched over to signify that they are inside of a cave, the best thing for you to do is to simply hunch over as well. If your scene partner steps out and picks an apple off of a tree, you could match them and pick an apple for yourself as well. If your scene partner starts a scene by skeet shooting, you could load a gun or pull a pair of earphones down around your neck. Both of these actions acknowledge and agree with the choice your partner has made about the character of the space.

Failing to come to basic agreement with regard to the character of the space can start your scenes out with implicit conflict.

A physical choice made by either improviser helps ground your scene from the start and can give you valuable information about the reality of your scene. When your scene partner initiates with a choice about the physical environment, you want to take this opportunity to connect with him or her immediately by starting your scene with some sort of physical agreement. Acknowledge their choice by doing something that mirrors or complements it. If they establish something about the environment, be in that environment as well, and establish something else about it if possible.

For example, if you start by washing dishes, we can assume that you are in a kitchen. Your scene partner doesn’t necessarily have to mirror this choice, but they must acknowledge it. If they choose to start drying dishes, they have established basic physical agreement. Both characters exist in this kitchen. Or, if your scene partner initiates by tearing off an order slip and flipping a burger, you can come to physical agreement with them by choosing to be another short order cook lowering some fries into oil or a waitress picking up dishes. Most Long Form shows will involve a few chairs on stage. Through basic nonverbal cues and the manipulation of these chairs, important choices about the physical environment can be made, and you will have an opportunity to start your scene with physical agreement. If your scene partner sets two chairs close together facing the audience, sits down, and mimes holding a steering wheel, you can come to physical agreement by simply sitting down in the passenger seat he or she has created. If your scene partner sets two chairs facing each other and points to the other chair, you can come to physical agreement with them simply by sitting in that other chair. You want to be aware of these physical cues so that you can always start off your scenes in agreement. If you choose to simply watch the activity of your scene partner instead of doing something that fits with that activity, you’re missing your first opportunity to Yes And, thereby beginning to build the base reality of your scene.

## Exercise: CHARACTER OF THE SPACE

One improviser will, in silence, make a choice that establishes one of the following aspects of the character of the space: activity (playing pool, fishing, stretching, etc.), location (automobile, prison cell, supermarket, etc.), or environmental condition (zero gravity, hot/cold, bright lights, etc.).

A second improviser will join the scene and nonverbally agree with the choice that has been made.

### Example: Activity
**Player 1:** steps out into the scene and begins folding laundry

**Player 2:** joins in by putting dirty laundry into a washing

### Example: Location
**Player 1:** steps out and mimes holding onto prison cell bars.

**Player 2:** stands next to him and holds out a mirror to see down the row of cells.

### Example: Environmental Condition
**Player 1:** steps out squinting with his hand in front of his face. **Player 2:** simply mirrors this behavior.

### Who, What, And Where

Before you can get to the game, in which you play with what is funny about the scene, you and your scene partner must agree on WHO your characters are, WHAT your characters are doing, and WHERE your characters are. The Who, What, and Where are essential to determining the foundation or base reality of the scene. Agreeing on who you are, what you are doing, and where you are at the top of the scene gives your scene a realistic context from which a first unusual thing can be discovered.

The sooner you establish the Who, What, and Where at the top of the scene, the better. It will be very difficult for you to determine what is unusual about your scene if you are a minute into the scene and still haven't determined this base reality. For example, bullets flying by your head would be very unusual if you are a teacher in a classroom but not if you are soldiers in the battlefield. Once again, the first unusual thing will be the beginning of your game, the funny part of your scene.

Don't be precious about the Who, What, and Where of your scene. Just get it out there. You don't need to “write in your head” and invest a lot of energy into making these choices since the real comedy of the scene will come from what you do with them. Don’t worry about making this part of the scene funny. You will be able to find the comedy in any Who, What, and Where. You just need to make sure that these essential elements of the scene are clear to you, your scene partner, and your audience so that you can all discover what is funny about those choices together.

Please note that while it is completely valid for a performer to establish the Who, What, and Where in a single line, it is not imperative that scenes must start this way. Remember that scenes are always built by both performers.

Let’s look at some examples of the very start of three different scenes in which the improvisers successfully establish the Who, What, and Where.

### Who, What, & Where Examples

### Example 1

**Player 1:** “The chicken’s done.” **Player 2:** “Oh good, honey. The Jensens will be here soon.”

**Player 1:** “Can you finish up the vegetables? I’m gonna go tidy up the living room.”

Player 1 starts the scene with a very simple initiation, but one that still establishes the What. (This person is cooking chicken.) Player 2 Yes Ands this choice by making the Who of the scene clearer. (By referring to Player 1 as “honey” and referring to the arrival of another couple, we can assume that this scene is about a married couple.) Player 1 then establishes a specific Where with the next line. (We can assume that this couple is currently in their kitchen.)

Now let’s see a bad example in which two improvisers fail to establish a strong Who, What and Where in the first three lines.

### Example 2

**Player 1:** “The chicken’s done.” **Player 2:** “Great, I love chicken!”

**Player 1:** “Let’s eat it right now.”

Player 1 still establishes the What, but the next two lines fail to expand on this information. (They “Yes” but do not “And.”) We never discover anything about who or where these people are. All we know is that they have cooked and are now going to eat chicken.

Let’s look at another example in which an improviser successfully establishes the Who, What, and Where in a single line.

### Example 3

**Player 1:** “Alright class, take your seats for the test.”

From this initiation, Player 1 is able to clearly establish the Who (Player 1 is a teacher addressing a group of students), What (the students are taking a test), and Where (a classroom). Now that the context of the scene has been set up so clearly, the improvisers can begin to look for the first unusual thing that breaks from this base reality.

Let’s take a look at two more examples of establishing the Who, What, and Where, one good and one bad.

### Example 4

Player 1 walks on stage, miming a coffee cup in his hand.

**Player 1:** “Thompson, get out of your cubicle...the Quarterly Report you submitted is only half finished!”

Player 1 has once again established the Who, What, and Where in his initiation. Note that there are multiple cues establishing information, both verbal and physical. Player 1 has communicated the Who through both naming his scene partner and how he has addressed them. Using the other character’s last name and speaking in angry tone about this report being unacceptable communicates to Player 2 that Player 1 has higher status. We can assume that Player 2 works for Player 1. Player 1 communicates the What by making it clear that this scene is about a boss reprimanding his employee. Finally, Player 1 communicates the Where by using the word “cubicle.” Now we can assume that the characters are in an office.

Here is an example of a weak initiation attempting to convey the same information established in Example 4.

### Example 5

Player 1 walks on stage neutrally. **Player 1:** “Thompson, I need to speak to you.”

This initiation from Player 1 is clearly lacking. First, we don’t know much about the Who. We know nothing about Player 1, and we only know that Player 2 is named Thompson. Player 1 could be a coach, sergeant, or teacher at this point because we have established status without establishing a specific relationship. We don’t know anything about the Where and we know very little about the What. Player

1 wants to talk to Thompson about something, but we don’t know what about.

Statements are the best way to efficiently establish the Who, What, and Where at the start of a scene. Avoid asking questions during the base reality section of a scene, since questions will only delay you from determining the context of your scene. In fact, asking questions will place the burden on your scene partner to provide this information. The rule of not asking questions only relates to the base reality section of the scene. Asking questions in the game section of the scene is acceptable and often necessary to play the game of the scene.

Your top priority in establishing the Who, What, and Where of a scene is to be clear. You should also look to be specific and personal whenever possible. Specificity will help your scenes stand out. Specifics are always funnier than generic choices. Making choices based on your own opinions and life experiences will make your choices personal. Being specific and personal will make your scenes engaging and relatable. Doing so will also often result in getting to your game in less time.

### Name Your CHARACTERS

It's good to include the specific names of the characters at the start of the scene. That way, they will be easy to identify as the longform progresses.

Novice improvisers are sSSometimes hesitant to quickly and clearly establish the Who, What, and Where. Instead, they remain vague out of deference to their scene partner. They erroneously feel that by establishing the Who, What, and Where, they are forcing their ideas onto their scene partner. This is not the case. In fact, there is nothing wrong with one improviser establishing the Who, What and Where in one line. Establishing the Who, What and Where quickly is not selfish. It is equivalent to priming a canvas before you paint. By providing as many details about the Who, What, and Where as you can early on, you are serving the scene and eliminating confusion. Make choices and be specific.

Conversely, don’t cut off your scene partner as they are initiating a scene. Give them a chance to get their idea out.

### Show, DON’T TELL

SSometimes nonverbal choices made at the top of the scene will help you to establish the Who, What and Where for your scene. “Show, don’t tell” is the phrase improvisers use to describe instances in scenes when an improviser establishes information through action and physical choices instead of speaking. When you “show” instead of “telling,” information is conveyed as clearly as it would be if spoken. Sometimes opting to follow the principle of “show, don’t tell” will actually make the start of your scene seem smoother and more natural. “Show, don’t tell” also often allows you to make your scene work more visually engaging.

Long Form is more than smart ideas and verbal gymnastics. You want to constantly remind yourself that the visual and physical aspects of your scene work are very important parts of the overall theatrical experience that your audience is having.

Instead of initiating a scene by saying, “I’m unloading the dishwasher,” you can simply start unloading it. This will allow you to establish the What and Where without being unnatural. Starting a scene by saying, “I’m a doctor and we are in an operating room, let’s get started with this surgery” is “telling.” Getting yourself engaged in the environment by washing up or putting on some surgical gloves is “showing.” Now you can focus on what is going on between the characters in the scene.

“Show, don’t tell” can also refer to starting scenes verbally but in an organic, realistic way. For example, initiating a scene by saying, “As your mother, I think you’re watching too much TV,’ would be unrealistic. In real life, people don’t speak in exposition. An example of verbal “show, don’t tell” would be to say anything you might expect to hear from a mom (e.g. “What have your father and I told you about watching so much TV?”).

Even though examples of “show, don’t tell” will often closely resemble what you do in real life, this skill will take time to develop. With practice, you and your scene partners will become better at communicating with each other subtly and realistically without overstating the reality of the scene.

Object Work

Since in Long Form improvisation there are no actual objects on stage (beyond chairs), the improvisers must mime those objects that would exist in a given reality. This is called object work. Handling and interacting with the objects in your scene’s fictional physical environment helps the improviser commit to their reality, and helps the audience buy into that same reality. For example, if it is established that you are playing a secretary, sitting down and miming a computer or a telephone will help ground your scene in a believable, physical reality. Additionally, object work can add another degree of theatricality to your performance.

After an environment has been established verbally, you can use your imagination to determine what else is there. By physically touching and using objects in that environment, you will be able to share your vision of your surroundings with your scene partner and the audience. We don’t want our Long Form scenes to be nothing more than a pair of “talking heads” exchanging ideas; we want them to be theatrical. Through object work, we can create the illusion of a visual setting for the scene. The audience will “see” the environment you are creating through object work. Object work helps you to make each scene scenic or visually engaging. In other words, object work offers your audience more of a “full experience” in terms of the Who, What, and Where of your scene. Sometimes object work can be employed before any lines are even spoken in order to establish the context of the scene quickly and non-verbally.

Object work can also act as a grounding force for you as a performer if you find yourself in a scene environment that is not completely familiar to you. Like a wig or a costume might help a sketch performer to “get into character,” object work can be a great way to immerse yourself in a performance and start feeling more like the character you are portraying. If your scene takes place on a ranch, it’s not imperative that you know everything about ranching to do the scene. You may have never worked on a ranch, but you’ve seen ranches on television or in movies. You could probably list several items you would find in a barn or out in a field. By miming one of these objects, you should find it easier to ground yourself in your performance as a ranch-hand.

Another benefit of object work is that it allows you to more closely mirror what happens in real life. When you visit the doctor, he or she usually doesn’t stand in front of you and trot out all of the medical information they have at their disposal. Chances are they probably will grab a chart or place an x-ray on a lighted screen—things that any of us are capable of miming in a scene. In this way, simple object work can help you to play a scene at the top of your intelligence.

Object work also allows you to use your environment as a way to slow down and think about what you are doing.

Many beginning improvisers get laughs in a scene without immediately understanding how or why they are making the audience laugh. If you stop and think about why you are getting those laughs, you won't run past the unusual thing. You will identify it so that you know what to build on. Object work gives the audience something to watch while you are doing this thinking. If you start washing dishes, the audience can watch your character do this while you (the improviser) can take a few seconds to process what is happening in the scene. The importance of those few seconds shouldn't be underestimated. Novice improvisers often find it hard to be comfortable in the silence. They will try to fill the “empty space” with chatter until something catches because they feel uncomfortable not talking on stage.

Object work allows you to analyze what has been established in your scene while giving the audience the impression that the fiction of the scene has continued unabated. Rather than standing there motionless, looking like an improviser who is at a loss for the next thing to say, you will look like a character that has taken a natural pause in their conversation while continuing to do their activity. As an improviser, you shouldn’t feel exposed as you do this thinking because the audience isn’t really watching you; they are watching a character.

Let’s say you're in a scene where you are playing a mechanic. You and your scene partner have just gotten a huge laugh from the audience that you feel could be your first unusual thing, but you aren't quite sure how to build on the moment. There are any number of object work choices you could make at this moment to keep your audience engaged in the scene. Open the hood of a car and take a look at the engine. Check the tire pressure. Pick up a wrench and work on an exposed engine block. All of these moves could easily be made while you think of your response, and your audience will feel that they’re watching a mechanic behave exactly as a mechanic does. If you don’t do anything, the audience will quickly lose confidence in you and most likely “see” you thinking. If you are doing object work confidently, the audience will have patience.

Note: the objects that you create during the base reality portion of the scene may become useful later in the game portion of the scene when you can use them as vehicles to explore the comedy of your scene.

One additional note: sSSometimes your object work may get unintentional laughs. Do not get seduced by those easy laughs and make object work the only funny aspect of your scene. Use your object work as another way to make everything except your single comedic idea seem real.

### Common Object Work MISTAKES

When miming objects, your goal should be to make them as real as possible. Remember that whenever you mime, your hand isn’t becoming the object; it is holding the object. If your character is holding a gun, don’t extend your index finger and raise your thumb like the “play guns” you made as a kid. Instead, you should actually pretend to hold a gun in your hand. Give it mass. If you don’t need it, put it in its holster.

The same goes for phones. Don’t hold out your thumb and pinky finger; pretend to hold an actual phone in your hand. Ask yourself what kind of phone you are holding. How big is it? Is it a cell phone or a desk phone? Do you have to flip it open? Does it have a touch screen?

In general you want to make all of your object work, just like every other aspect of your scene outside of your single comedic idea, seem realistic and normal. Don’t cartoonishly bang your hands up and down if your character is using a typewriter. Don’t just abruptly stand up if your character is in a car. Open the door and step out.

Be consistent; mime all of the objects you use on stage. This includes objects you might have with you, such as keys, phones, wallets, clothing, and shoes. You don’t want to use both real and mimed objects in your scenes (e.g. a robber using a mimed gun to take a real wallet). It’s jarring. Once you see one real object in the space, it sets up the expectation that everything should be real, which is an expectation that you cannot fulfill as an improviser. Imagine if an actor in a play where props are being used suddenly pulled out a mimed gun. This would be very distracting. An improviser using an actual object in a scene has the same effect.

Another reason not to use actual objects is that doing so can paint you into a corner. While you could take off your actual jacket, you could not hang it on an imaginary coat rack.

The one exception to not using actual objects on stage is chairs, as some scenes will require you to sit.

Taking these aspects of your objects into consideration will help you to better commit to your reality. It will make your acting more realistic and help you to visualize your environment.

### Bad Object WORK

Here are some frequent object work mistakes:

Constantly steering back and forth while driving instead of just holding onto a steering wheel

Driving a car while sitting cross-legged in a chair

Holding a beer one moment and then dropping it without putting it down on a surface

Walking through a table or desk

### Helpful HINTS
Before we move on, please keep in mind these two additional points that are important to the beginning of any Long Form scene.

First, it is important for you to maintain the environment that has been established during the base reality section throughout the rest of the scene. Many new improvisers will “drop” their environment once they begin talking. Keeping your characters grounded in the world established at the start of the scene will help you to keep your audience engaged in the reality you have created. Also remember, you will later be able to use this environment as a vehicle through which you can explore the comedy of your scene.

Additionally, while establishing the base reality of your scene is very important, you want to be sure to avoid simply talking about whatever it is that you and your scene partner are doing. Once you start speaking, you don’t want to just speak about your physical environment. In order to more closely mirror real life, you should push yourself to determine the Who, What and Where of the scene by talking about something else as you remain engaged in the physical choices you’ve made. If you think about it, this is how we usually behave in real life. Your goal should be to simply exist in your Who, What, and Where.”

## Exercise: TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

### Instructions
Two improvisers take the stage.

One improviser will initiate with some sort of physical activity that can be done continuously throughout the scene (sorting mail, washing dishes, having dinner, playing golf, setting up a camp site, etc.).

The other improviser should immediately join in with this activity.

When either improviser starts speaking, they must talk about something other than what they are doing.

PURPOSES

In real life, you are usually doing one thing and talking about another. For example, if you’re folding laundry, you are most likely not talking about folding laundry. This exercise will help you to better mirror this reality of life in your scenes.
