Label below: "ИГРА: Овощи" (GAME: Vegetables) - using wordplay where "ИГРА" means both "Game" (improv concept) and "game/play" (activity). MIDDLE BRANCH: A smiling stick figure holding an onion bulb in one hand and a salt shaker in the other, with speech bubble "чеснок, перец" (garlic, pepper).

The wordplay "ИГРА" works in Russian context meaning both the improv "Game" concept and "game/play" as activity. Simple black line drawings on white background. Clean sans-serif Cyrillic typography.
