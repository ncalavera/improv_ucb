and this is the official
foreword for The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual.
This book is a comprehensive guide to the UCB style of long form
improvisation. It is an attempt to help clearly explain how we improvise,
why we improvise, and what we think works best when performing long
form improvisation. Now, if none of the words in that last sentence make
any sense to you"you’re in luck! This book assumes you know nothing,
It contains real and practical information on improvisation, without
assuming you know the basics.
We love to improvise and we take this funny art form very seriously.
We attempt to take a pragmatic approach at how to explain the “rules” of
long form improvisation. We have all improvised most of our adult lives
and we have combined our experiences as performers and teachers in
an attempt to clearly lay out ways to describe the UCB style.
Improvisation is about having a real sense of trust with your partner.
It’s about sharing a language that allows you the freedom to play.
Creativity among structure. Risk among rules. In this book you will learn
!

about group mind, playing to the top of your intelligence, and finding
the game. It investigates everything from the simple beginning steps of
getting a suggestion, to building base realities that can lead you to all
different types of improv forms.
The hope is that this instruction can guide you or your group into a
real sense of flow. There is nothing better than the feeling of being lost
in that magical and creative improvisational zone. But before you get the
rush of the wind in your hair during an exciting downhill bike ride, you
need to learn how to put your foot on the bike pedals and find your brake.
Here is another metaphor, if improvisation is a game of basketball,
then this book is the manual that teaches you to play. Once you get on
the court and know how to play, it becomes about the team and the flow
and energy of each game. But that creative and fluid experience can only
be reached if you know the fundamentals. And if you can’t take a UCB
improv class in person this is the next, best thing.
So let’s get started. We hope this book helps. And on behalf of all of
us, thanks for buying it.

Here′s a brief history of the UCB and the UCB Theatre. This is to give
a context of where and how the authors learned improv and developed
the philosophies that this book describes.
We, the authors of this book—Matt Besser, Ian Roberts and Matt
Walsh—have had a lot of experience performing and teaching improv
over the last thirty years.
The three of us, along with Amy Poehler, first met in Chicago in the
early 1990s, where we performed improv and sketch as the Upright
Citizens Brigade.
Chicago has always been fertile ground for young improv talent.
Long Form improv essentially started there in the late 1950s when
young actors such as Mike Nichols and Elaine May started performing
improvised shows, inspired by the teachings of Viola Spolin and others.
Famed comedy theater the Second City was founded shortly after.
The 1990s saw an explosion of talent in the Chicago improv scene.
A big part of this was the iO Theater, founded in the 1980s by Charna
Halpern with longtime improv teacher and director Del Close.
Presenting a large number of shows each week, iO allowed lots of young
and hungry talent to get stage time. Among the performers who began
their careers in 1990s Chicago were Tina Fey, Adam McKay, Rachel
Dratch, Scott Adsit, Andy Richter, Horatio Sanz, Seth Meyers, Jon
Favreau—and many others. We were among this generation. The UCB
was part of a movement of fast, aggressive improv comedy that was
absurd but still, at its core, grounded.
In 1996, the UCB decided to move from Chicago to New York City
hoping to get on television. We rose up through the ranks of the local
alternative comedy scene, soon realizing our goal of getting on television
when Comedy Central gave us a sketch show that ran for three seasons.
%

During this time, we performed improv shows and taught improv
classes, providing our take on the skills we’d learned in Chicago. We
opened our own theater, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, in New
York in 1999. In 2005, we opened a second theater in Los Angeles.
Thousands of people have taken classes at the UCB. Among our
alumni are many people who have gone on to professional success in
movies and television. As we are writing this book, a small sampling
includes: Anthony Atamanuik, Rachel Bloom, Nicole Byer, D’Arcy
Carden, Rob Corddry, Andy Daly, Jon Daly, Brett Gelman, Ilana Glazer,
Donald Glover, Rob Huebel, Abbi Jacobson, Lauren Lapkus, Kate
McKinnon, Jason Mantzoukas, Bobby Moynihan, Ego Nwodim, Adam
Pally, Lennon Parham, Aubrey Plaza, June Raphael, Rob Riggle, Paul
Scheer, Ben Schwartz, Jessica St. Clair, Casey Wilson, Zach Woods,
Sasheer Zamata, and many many more.
In addition to those achieving fame, there are many other students
who became terrific regular performers on the UCB stages, and
eventually teachers. The four original UCB members, as well as the
teachers they trained, started writing down their teaching philosophy
as a curriculum. Many people contributed to this endeavor—including
Owen Burke, Kevin Mullaney, Chris Gethard, and Joe Wengert. The
teachings were a mixture of Chicago-style Long Form, with the UCB’s
focus on finding the “game of the scene,” combined with new techniques
that evolved through our classes.
In 2011, we started writing this book. We published the first edition
in 2013. In 2019, we revised it, making many small revisions throughout,
including new exercises, updated terms and examples and a major
rewrite of the “pattern game” section.

It’s a great irony that to get good at comedy, you have to take it seriously.
This is especially surprising when first looking at Long Form improv
comedy. Scenes can be so absurd and unpredictable, you might assume
that anything goes. Since there are no costumes or props or script, you
might feel improv requires no preparation.
But of course that’s not true. Though there are no HARD rules, improv
works best when the players adhere to a clear set of guidelines everyone
has practiced. You !"#$#%!, you &’"#$()$(*%$()&$)+$#),-$./(%’’.0%/1%2$#),$
’))3$+)-$,/,!,"’$(*./0!2$#),$*%.0*(%/$"/4$%5&’)-% (we explain all these
principles later).
As for preparation, it’s true you can’t rehearse a scene that you
make up on the spot. But all good improvisers invest a lot of time doing
&

234.-15642-3"#"4-,$5&’,$+1$3-,$67,8,
exercises, practices, and shows so they’re comfortable with anything
that comes their way.
Improv is fun, for sure. But it’s not easy. It’s an art form, which
requires discipline and practice.
At the time we are writing this book, we have been performing
and teaching improv for almost thirty years. We love improv, we’ve
worked hard at it, and we take it seriously. This book will teach you the
guidelines we use.
$F8’Q>R8’0M’.F8’BC818
There are two general types of improv: Short Form improvisation
and Long Form improvisation.
In Short Form improvisation, a group plays a series of established
“games” in which the group tells the audience the rules and structure
ahead of time. Something like “In this game, two people will do a scene
while a third person keeps shouting different emotions for them to play.”
We don’t practice Short Form at the UCB Theatre. It can be entertaining,
but the downside is Short Form games tend to be very similar each time
you do them.
We do Long Form improvisation. That means creating one or more
scenes without a script. You don’t know for sure where the humor will
come from. Ideally, Long Form scenes look like written sketches. This
is a tradition of comedy that grew out of the Chicago theater scene and
included the improv duo Nichols and May, and theater companies like
the Second City, iO Theater and others).
For example, you have a scene of a fireman talking to his chief. You
discover the fireman wants to stop using sirens on trucks. “They’re too
scary, it makes people panic,” he reasons. He wants instead to use a very
upbeat theme song he’s written called “Hooray for the Firemen!” He also
wants to replace the “intimidating” dalmatian with a bunny rabbit, and
wants helmets painted rainbow colors, like a clown’s wig, instead of an
“alarming” red.
There was no plan going into the scene. But we still say this scene
had a game. It was a game we discovered along the way. You might call
it:$"$6-%7"/$())$8)--.%4$"9),($!1"-./0$&%)&’%:
We call this the game of the scene. The game of the scene, in the
simplest terms possible, is the single specific idea that makes a scene
funny. The unusual point of view, the surprising behavior, the absurd
character, whatever it is. Each scene’s game is unique. If you know what
the game of the scene is, you know what to explore and heighten to
further what’s making the scene funny.
’

Finding games in Long Form is harder than in Short Form. But if you
do it well, it’s more satisfying, more surprising and unique, and funnier.
The concept of the game of the scene is the linchpin of the Upright
Citizens Brigade’s teaching and performance of Long Form improv.
We learned to use the term “game” in Long Form while studying with
legendary Chicago improv teachers Del Close and Charna Halpern in the
1990s. But since then, we’ve expanded the concept and used it to make
the free-form nature of Long Form improv have a measurable goal: find
a game and play it.

Just reading this book alone will not make you a great improviser. You
will also need constant practice and performance. As with any other art
form, you will not become a competent improviser by just reading about
how to do it. Experience will be your best teacher, so you must find the
time to practice and perform as much as possible.
But it’s our hope that this book will be a foundation for anyone
interested in performing Long Form improv. Maybe you live in a place
where there’s not a local improv scene. This book should give you
enough information to get started. It provides exercises, examples, and
structures for shows, as well as vocabulary terms you can use to discuss
scenes among your group.
Improv is a deeply satisfying art form, in which you work together to
create great comedy: surprising, truthful, absurd, and fun. We hope this
book helps you love it just as much as we do.

Let’s go over the basic anatomy of an improv scene. There are many
terms in this section which we’ll go over later. This is just a quick
overview of what we’re going to cover.
We start an improv scene with what we call the “base reality” section
of the scene. As we said before, this is the general scenario of what’s
going on. Ex: A parent and child driving to school, a patient visiting the
doctor for a checkup, a cowboy walking into a saloon and ordering a
whiskey. This section of the scene sets up a realistic world with expected
rules or patterns of behavior which can then be broken for comedic
effect. We create this section of the scene using the improv principle of
“Yes And.”
The base reality section continues until we find a “first unusual thing,”
which breaks the expected pattern of the base reality. At this point we
enter the section known as “the game” of the scene. Ex: The drill sergeant
who’s into yoga, the mom who wants her kids to vandalize the school, the
waiter who is so pretentious that he rejects all customers’ orders.
We find the game of the scene by using the improv principle of
“If Then,” continually asking the question, “If this unusual thing is
true, then what else is true?” The answers to this question provide the
comedic content of the game.

The
Beginning
of a Scene
In this section of the book, we go over how to create what we call a
base reality. That’s the world of the scene. It’s the who-what-where,
the general situation, the context, the what’s-going-on. A football team
meeting at halftime. Two friends sitting next to each other on the
subway. Even something fantastical like two aliens negotiating a peace
treaty to end the global insect wars. These are all possible base realities
for a scene.
The UCB coined the term base reality to emphasize that this is the
base of our scene. We’ll build the comedy—the game—on top of it.
That means the base reality should not be played for laughs. Even if it’s
fantastical, it’s played “real” relative to its situation. This is important
because we’ll need to be able to identify the first unusual thing that
happens—relative to this base reality—to start finding the game.
Agreement is crucial when we start our scenes. We go over how
the classic improv mantra Yes And lets you quickly build a base reality
together. We also discuss the importance of good listening, strong
commitment, and playing realistically when developing your base reality.

These two simple words are the building blocks of
every Long Form improv scene. “Yes” refers to the idea that you should
be agreeing with any information your scene partner gives you about
your reality. “And” refers to the adding of new information that relates
to the previous information. Yes And is very important at the beginning
of every scene, since it will allow you and your scene partner to discover
the base reality in which your characters exist.
When we speak to people in real life, we move the conversation
forward by adding new information in response to what has already
been communicated. Imagine that you are talking with a group of
friends. If everybody else is telling stories about their dog, and you
start talking about how good you are at basketball out of the blue,
you haven’t added to the conversation already in progress. In order to
successfully participate in this conversation, you should offer another
dog story. Yes And is how we mirror this process in our scene work.
At the very start of a Long Form scene, you and your scene partner
will have absolutely no information about who your characters are,
what they are doing, and where they are. By following the principle of
Yes And, you can work together to quickly determine the base reality
of the scene. By continually agreeing with what has been established
and adding new, related information, you will establish a base reality
against which you will be able to recognize the first unusual thing
when it happens. This is important because the 6-!($,/,!,"’$(*./0 is the
beginning of the game, or comedy, of the scene.
In general, make Yes And choices that add details about the
present moment or the people in the scene. Do not add information
about the past, the future, or people who aren’t there.
Think of a Long Form scene as a painting. If you were going to
paint your idea in blue, you wouldn’t want to start with a blue canvas.
))%%

You wouldn’t be able to differentiate between the foundation and your
art. Blue doesn’t show up well on blue. Starting scenes with a clearly
communicated and specific base reality is like starting your scenes
with a white canvas on which the blue paint of what is funny will show
up vibrantly.

To begin Yes Anding, you need a first line for your scene. The first line
of an improv scene is called the initiation. Although you could conjure
this out of nothing, the initiation is usually inspired by a suggestion
provided by someone other than the performers. A suggestion is taken
for two reasons. First, the suggestion serves as inspiration for the
improvisers. Second, it proves that they are indeed improvising and that
the scene has not been scripted.
When you get a suggestion, you want to notice the connection you
immediately make to it in your mind, and then use that connection to
fashion an initiation. The suggestion may or may not be used in the
initiation, depending on the connection you have made.
%YITH?%’BNQQ%B$#L&;’9><<001
If “balloon” made you think of how your mother used to tie
balloons to your wrist so you didn’t lose them, you might offer the
following initiation:
#&#$#I$#L&’L&%;’’Z’#[R’A0+1A’.0’.+8’.F8’9><<001’’

If “balloon” made you think of a birthday party, you might offer the
following initiation:
#&#$#I$#L&’$!L;’’’Z’LS>:X’9<0U’0=.’.F8’C>1/<8-’>1/’’
R>S8’>’U+-F\]
In both of these examples, the audience should see the connection
between the suggestion and your initiation.
Make sure that your initiation line starts the scene “in the middle of
things.” You want an initiation that allows you to get to the important
part of an interaction as quickly as possible. Avoid any extraneous
dialogue leading up to this moment.
Notice that in our first example, we didn’t need to start with the
characters noticing the balloon vendor or the transaction of buying
the balloon. In the second example, we didn’t need to start with people
arriving at the party or people placing gifts on the gift table. In both
examples, we cut to the chase by starting “in the middle.”
You should initiate off of your suggestion immediately. If you hesitate,
it shows that you are planning and not improvising.

saying the words “Yes And” before you add new information.

New improvisers often look to force something “crazy” or “wacky” at
the beginning of scenes, or they will rush to a conflict 7#-’#&0:)%-59’

being funny and do not yet have faith in the rules of improv.

Agreement
!"#$%$&$’%
!"#$%&’%#($#)%’*(’
!a Long Form scene with another
improviser, the very first thing you must do is come to !"#$$%$&’ with
each other about the basic context of the scene you are performing.
Imagine that you are going to dance with someone. Are you going to
waltz or salsa? You would be able to tell almost immediately from the
first action your dance partner takes. Joining in with this first choice
()*$’*$#+,’+,-+)!.’/+0#+-!.-!1+may seem very obvious and simple, but it is
undoubtedly essential if dancing is to happen at all. A failure to come
to basic agreement about the context of the scene stops a scene from
succeeding before it even starts.
Two improvisers should be looking to agree from the very start of the
scene. It is important to note that even though you are in the pursuit of
comedy, you are not “going for laughs” at this point in a scene. You are
going for the establishment of a reality. Normally, what we find to be
“funny” in a scene is a break from the expected norms of reality. For the
unusual to stand out from the commonplace, it is important that you and
your partner start the scene in agreement about a normal reality. If you
start off a scene in which everything is crazy or funny, it will be difficult
to determine what is unusual.
!"#$#!%&$’()’%"&’*+#!&
The most basic form of agreement involves the 2*!#!2’$#+03+’*$+-4!2$.
As soon as two improvisers walk on stage—before they even begin
talking—they are more likely to find success if they can come to a basic
agreement about the physical and/or emotional state of their characters.
As you enter a scene, your first job is to acknowledge any choice
about the character of the space that your scene partner has made.
(Your scene partner will do the same if you are the one to step out
first.) You should then find a way to fit into that same physical space.
For example, if your scene partner steps out and is shivering, you
could mirror or match this action and shiver as well. You are agreeing
that it is cold. You are allowing your characters to start off in the same
environmental condition.
Maybe your scene partner has stepped out, sighed, and mimed
mopping their brow with a handkerchief. If you enter the scene fanning
"#

()*+&",-’%"!$!+,*(#-.#*#/*.’#0’*1-(23
your face, you have acknowledged the character of the space without
matching your partner’s exact physical choice. You are showing that your
character is also hot in a different way.
You can also come to agreement about the character of the space
through the physical environment of the scene or an activity your
characters might be engaged in. If your scene partner starts the scene
hunched over to signify that they are inside of a cave, the best thing for
you to do is to simply hunch over as well. If your scene partner steps
out and picks an apple off of a tree, you could match them and pick an
apple for yourself as well. If your scene partner starts a scene by skeet
shooting, you could load a gun or pull a pair of earphones down around
your neck. Both of these actions acknowledge and agree with the choice
your partner has made about the character of the space.
Failing to come to basic agreement with regard to the character of the
space can start your scenes out with implicit conflict.
A physical choice made by either improviser helps ground your scene
from the start and can give you valuable information about the reality
of your scene. When your scene partner initiates with a choice about
the physical environment, you want to take this opportunity to connect
with him or her immediately by starting your scene with some sort of
physical agreement. Acknowledge their choice by doing something
that mirrors or complements it. If they establish something about the
environment, be in that environment as well, and establish something
else about it if possible.
""

For example, if you start by washing dishes, we can assume that you
are in a kitchen. Your scene partner doesn’t necessarily have to mirror
this choice, but they must acknowledge it. If they choose to start drying
dishes, they have established basic physical agreement. Both characters
exist in this kitchen.
Or, if your scene partner initiates by tearing off an order slip and
flipping a burger, you can come to physical agreement with them by
choosing to be another short order cook lowering some fries into oil or a
waitress picking up dishes.
Most Long Form shows will involve a few chairs on stage. Through
basic nonverbal cues and the manipulation of these chairs, important
choices about the physical environment can be made, and you will have
an opportunity to start your scene with physical agreement.
If your scene partner sets two chairs close together facing the
audience, sits down, and mimes holding a steering wheel, you can come
to physical agreement by simply sitting down in the passenger seat he or
she has created. If your scene partner sets two chairs facing each other
and points to the other chair, you can come to physical agreement with
them simply by sitting in that other chair.
You want to be aware of these physical cues so that you can always
start off your scenes in agreement. If you choose to simply watch the
activity of your scene partner instead of doing something that fits with
that activity, you’re missing your first opportunity to Yes And, thereby
beginning to build the base reality of your scene.

Before you can get to the game, in which you play with what is funny
about the scene, you and your scene partner must agree on WHO
your characters are, WHAT your characters are doing, and WHERE
your characters are. The 5*06+5*!’6+!&7+5*$#$ are essential to
determining the foundation or base reality of the scene. Agreeing on
who you are, what you are doing, and where you are at the top of the
scene gives your scene a realistic context from which a first unusual
thing can be discovered.
The sooner you establish the Who, What, and Where at the top of
the scene, the better. It will be very difficult for you to determine what
is unusual about your scene if you are a minute into the scene and still
"&

haven’t determined this base reality. For example, bullets flying by
your head would be very unusual if you are a teacher in a classroom
but not if you are soldiers in the battlefield. Once again, the first
unusual thing will be the beginning of your game, the funny part of
your scene.
Don’t be precious about the Who, What, and Where of your scene.
Just get it out there. You don’t need to “write in your head” and invest
a lot of energy into making these choices since the real comedy of
the scene will come from what you do with them. Don’t worry about
making this part of the scene funny. You will be able to find the
comedy in any Who, What, and Where. You just need to make sure
that these essential elements of the scene are clear to you, your scene
partner, and your audience so that you can all discover what is funny
about those choices together.
Please note that while it is completely valid for a performer to
establish the Who, What, and Where in a single line, it is not imperative
that scenes must start this way. Remember that scenes are always built
by both performers.
Let’s look at some examples of the very start of three different
scenes in which the improvisers successfully establish the Who,
What, and Where.

Now let’s see a bad example in which two improvisers fail to establish a
strong Who, What and Where in the first three lines.

Player 1 still establishes the What, but the next two lines fail to expand
on this information. (8*$<+?D$-@+CB’+70+&0’+?E&7:@1 We never discover
anything about who or where these people are. All we know is that they
have cooked and are now going to eat chicken.
Let’s look at another example in which an improviser successfully
establishes the Who, What, and Where in a single line.
&,#-+.&’V
+.#5&$’6/- D#>;2KE1’0>9HHA’19F=’48O;’H=91H’P8;’1E=’1=H1IJ
From this initiation, Player 1 is able to clearly establish the Who (=.!<$#+

!+’$-’1, and Where (!+2.!--#00%1. Now that the context of the scene has
been set up so clearly, the improvisers can begin to look for the first
unusual thing that breaks from this base reality.
Let’s take a look at two more examples of establishing the Who, What,
and Where, one good and one bad.
&,#-+.&’W
=.!<$#+>+)!.9-+0&+-’!"$6+%,%,&"+!+20F$$+2B4+,&+*,-+*!&7:+

E9>P’P2:2HE=?UJ
Player 1 has once again established the Who, What, and Where in his
initiation. Note that there are multiple cues establishing information,
both verbal and physical. Player 1 has communicated the Who through
both naming his scene partner and *0) he has addressed them. Using
"(

the other character’s last name and speaking in angry tone about this
report being unacceptable communicates to Player 2 that Player 1 has
higher status. We can assume that Player 2 works for Player 1. Player 1
communicates the What by making it clear that this scene is about a boss
reprimanding his employee. Finally, Player 1 communicates the Where
by using the word “cubicle.” Now we can assume that the characters are
in an office.
Here is an example of a weak initiation attempting to convey the same
information established in Example 4.
&,#-+.&’Z
=.!<$#+>+)!.9-+0&+-’!"$+&$B’#!..<:+
+.#5&$’6/- D%E8<QH8:A’S’:==?’18’HQ=9F’18’48OIJ
This initiation from Player 1 is clearly lacking. First, we don’t know
much about the Who. We know nothing about Player 1, and we only
know that Player 2 is named Thompson. Player 1 could be a coach,
sergeant, or teacher at this point because we have established status
without establishing a specific relationship. We don’t know anything
about the Where and we know very little about the What. Player
1 wants to talk to Thompson about something, but we don’t know
what about.
Statements are the best way to efficiently establish the Who,
What, and Where at the start of a scene. Avoid asking questions
during the base reality section of a scene, since questions will only
delay you from determining the context of your scene. In fact,
asking questions will place the burden on your scene partner to
provide this information. The rule of not asking questions only
relates to the base reality section of the scene. Asking questions in
the game section of the scene is acceptable and often necessary to
play the game of the scene.
Your top priority in establishing the Who, What, and Where of a
scene is to be clear. You should also look to be specific and personal
whenever possible. Specificity will help your scenes stand out.
Specifics are always funnier than generic choices. Making choices
based on your own opinions and life experiences will make your
choices personal. Being specific and personal will make your scenes
engaging and relatable. Doing so will also often result in getting to
your game in less time.

Novice improvisers are sometimes hesitant to quickly and clearly
establish the Who, What, and Where. Instead, they remain vague out
of deference to their scene partner. They erroneously feel that by
establishing the Who, What, and Where, they are forcing their ideas
onto their scene partner. This is not the case. In fact, there is nothing
wrong with one improviser establishing the Who, What and Where in
one line. Establishing the Who, What and Where quickly is not selfish.
It is equivalent to priming a canvas before you paint. By providing as
many details about the Who, What, and Where as you can early on,
you are serving the scene and eliminating confusion. Make choices
and be specific.
Conversely, don’t cut off your scene partner as they are initiating a
scene. Give them a chance to get their idea out.

Object Work
Since in Long Form improvisation there are no actual objects on
stage !"#$%&’()*+,-./, the improvisers must mime those objects that
would exist in a given reality. This is called %"0#)1(2%-3. Handling
and interacting with the objects in your scene’s fictional physical
environment helps the improviser commit to their reality, and
helps the audience buy into that same reality. For example, if it is
established that you are playing a secretary, sitting down and miming
a computer or a telephone will help ground your scene in a believable,
physical reality. Additionally, object work can add another degree of
theatricality to your performance.
%#

()*+&",-’%"!$!+,*(#-.#*#/*.’#0’*1-(23
After an environment has been established verbally, you can
use your imagination to determine what else is there. By physically
touching and using objects in that environment, you will be able to
share your vision of your surroundings with your scene partner and
the audience. We don’t want our Long Form scenes to be nothing more
than a pair of “talking heads” exchanging ideas; we want them to be
theatrical. Through object work, we can create the illusion of a visual
setting for the scene. The audience will “see” the environment you
are creating through object work. Object work helps you to make each
scene scenic or visually engaging. In other words, object work offers
your audience more of a “full experience” in terms of the Who, What,
and Where of your scene. Sometimes object work can be employed
before any lines are even spoken in order to establish the context of the
scene quickly and non-verbally.
Object work can also act as a grounding force for you as a performer
if you find yourself in a scene environment that is not completely
familiar to you. Like a wig or a costume might help a sketch performer
to “get into character,” object work can be a great way to immerse
yourself in a performance and start feeling more like the character you
are portraying. If your scene takes place on a ranch, it’s not imperative
that you know everything about ranching to do the scene. You may have
never worked on a ranch, but you’ve seen ranches on television or in
movies. You could probably list several items you would find in a barn or
out in a field. By miming one of these objects, you should find it easier to
ground yourself in your performance as a ranch-hand.
Another benefit of object work is that it allows you to more closely
mirror what happens in real life. When you visit the doctor, he or she
usually doesn’t stand in front of you and trot out all of the medical
information they have at their disposal. Chances are they probably will
grab a chart or place an x-ray on a lighted screen—things that any of us
are capable of miming in a scene. In this way, simple object work can
help you to play a scene at the top of your intelligence.
Object work also allows you to use your environment as a way to slow
down and think about what you are doing.
Many beginning improvisers get laughs in a scene without
immediately understanding how or why they are making the audience
laugh. If you stop and think about why you are getting those laughs,
you won’t run past the unusual thing. You will identify it so that you
know what to build on. Object work gives the audience something to
watch while you are doing this thinking. If you start washing dishes, the
audience can watch your character do this while you(!1*#(,45-%6,.#-/(
can take a few seconds to process what is happening in the scene. The
importance of those few seconds shouldn’t be underestimated. Novice
improvisers often find it hard to be comfortable in the silence. They will
try to fill the “empty space” with chatter until something catches because
they feel uncomfortable not talking on stage.
%"

Object work allows you to analyze what has been established in your
scene while giving the audience the impression that the fiction of the
scene has continued unabated. Rather than standing there motionless,
looking like an improviser who is at a loss for the next thing to say,
you will look like a character that has taken a natural pause in their
conversation while continuing to do their activity. As an improviser, you
shouldn’t feel exposed as you do this thinking because the audience isn’t
really watching you; they are watching a character.
Let’s say you’re in a scene where you are playing a mechanic. You
and your scene partner have just gotten a huge laugh from the audience
that you feel could be your first unusual thing, but you aren’t quite sure
how to build on the moment. There are any number of object work
choices you could make at this moment to keep your audience engaged
in the scene. Open the hood of a car and take a look at the engine.
Check the tire pressure. Pick up a wrench and work on an exposed
engine block. All of these moves could easily be made while you think
of your response, and your audience will feel that they’re watching a
mechanic behave exactly as a mechanic does. If you don’t do anything,
the audience will quickly lose confidence in you and most likely “see”
you thinking. If you are doing object work confidently, the audience will
have patience.

When miming objects, your goal should be to make them as real as
possible. Remember that whenever you mime, your hand isn’t becoming
the object; it is holding the object. If your character is holding a gun,
don’t extend your index finger and raise your thumb like the “play guns”
you made as a kid. Instead, you should actually pretend to hold a gun in
your hand. Give it mass. If you don’t need it, put it in its holster.
The same goes for phones. Don’t hold out your thumb and pinky
finger; pretend to hold an actual phone in your hand. Ask yourself what
kind of phone you are holding. How big is it? Is it a cell phone or a desk
phone? Do you have to flip it open? Does it have a touch screen?
In general you want to make all of your object work, just like every
other aspect of your scene outside of your single comedic idea, seem
realistic and normal. Don’t cartoonishly bang your hands up and down if
%%

your character is using a typewriter. Don’t just abruptly stand up if your
character is in a car. Open the door and step out.
Be consistent; mime all of the objects you use on stage. This includes
objects you might have with you, such as keys, phones, wallets, clothing,
and shoes. You don’t want to use both real and mimed objects in your
scenes(!#<8<(+(-%""#-(7.,&8(+(4,4#’(87&(1%(1+3#(+(-#+9(2+99#1/. It’s jarring.
Once you see one real object in the space, it sets up the expectation that
everything should be real, which is an expectation that you cannot fulfill
as an improviser. Imagine if an actor in a play where props are being
%&

used suddenly pulled out a mimed gun. This would be very distracting.
An improviser using an actual object in a scene has the same effect.
Another reason not to use actual objects is that doing so can paint you
into a corner. While you could take off your actual jacket, you could not
hang it on an imaginary coat rack.
The one exception to not using actual objects on stage is chairs, as
some scenes will require you to sit.
Taking these aspects of your objects into consideration will help you
to better commit to your reality. It will make your acting more realistic
and help you to visualize your environment.

Before we move on, please keep in mind these two additional points that
are important to the beginning of any Long Form scene.
First, it is important for you to maintain the environment that has
been established during the base reality section throughout the rest of
the scene. Many new improvisers will “drop” their environment once
they begin talking. Keeping your characters grounded in the world
established at the start of the scene will help you to keep your audience
engaged in the reality you have created. Also remember, you will later be
able to use this environment as a vehicle through which you can explore
the comedy of your scene.
Additionally, while establishing the base reality of your scene is very
important, you want to be sure to avoid simply talking about whatever it
is that you and your scene partner are doing. Once you start speaking,
you don’t want to just speak about your physical environment. In order
to more closely mirror real life, you should push yourself to determine
the Who, What and Where of the scene by talking about .%4#1*,&8(#9.#(
as you remain engaged in the physical choices you’ve made. If you think
about it, this is how we usually behave in real life. Your goal should be to
simply exist in your Who, What, and Where.”
